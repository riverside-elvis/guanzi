# Appendix: Transcriber's Notes

This is a mashup of
base text from [ctext](https://ctext.org/guanzi/)
and W. Allyn Rickett's translation of the four "Xin shu" chapters from
_Guanzi: Political, Economic, and Philosophical Essays from Early China_,
A study and translation, *Volume Two*, 1998.

Rickett used as base texts
the *Sibu congkan* photographic reprint of the Yang Chen edition
and the *Sibu beiyao* print of the Zhao Yongxian edition,
but emends them extensively
based on the research of
a large number of commentators.

Ctext's version is *Sibu congkan*,
which I've merged without modification
into Rickett's emended translation.
Rickett's footnotes explain his emendations.
