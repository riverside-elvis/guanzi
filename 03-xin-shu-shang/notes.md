[^xin-shu-shang-13]: *Gwan* 官, "office," or "office holder,"
also can mean "sense organ."
 Thus the _Xunzi_, XI, 17/10a9-10 (Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 3:16), states:
"The heart/mind occupies the central cavity
in order to control the five sense organs.
Now for this reason it is referred to as the natural prince."
The nine apertures are the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, and sex organ.

[^xin-shu-shang-14]: Irregular rhyme:
道 (group 幽, 4th tone)
with 理 (group 之, second tone).

[^xin-shu-shang-15]: Emending 益 to 盈
to complete the rhyme with 聲, "sounds" [Wang Niansun].

[^xin-shu-shang-16]: Igai, Dai Wang, and Yu Yue would delete 故曰,
"Therefore it is said," as an interpolation
taken from the explanation (3a1; 63.13).
Guo Moruo argues that the two characters indicate that this statement
is a quotation from some other text and should be retained.

[^xin-shu-shang-17]: Irregular rhyme:
道 (group 幽, 4th tone) with
事 (group 之, 3rd tone).
He Ruzhang would insert here a line
from the explanation (3a 1-2; 63.13):
心術者無為而制疲者也,
"The art of the mind lies in
controlling the apertures through nonassertiveness."
I would question this emendation because such a sentence,
coming at the end of the statement,
appears as a non sequitur and violates the established rhyme pattern.
The only logical place for it would be following the second sentence
concerning the nine appertures,
but this does not accord with the sequence of the ideas
presented in the explanation.
For further discussion of this problem,
see my introductory comments and n. 36, below.

[^xin-shu-shang-18]: The Yang edition for 潔 writes 絜.
The meaning remains the same.

[^xin-shu-shang-19]: Emending 乃 to 不
in accordance with the Zhu edition [Dai Wang, Ding Shihan, and Yu Yue].

[^xin-shu-shang-20]: Deleting 乎
as an interpolation from the following line [Wang Niansun and Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-shang-21]: Emending 處得 to 虚及 [Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-shang-22]: Emending 正 to 聖 [Wang Niansun].

[^xin-shu-shang-23]: Emending 無虚無 to 虚而 [Wang hiansun].
The Li Shan 李善 commentary to the _Wen xuan_, 20/13a13 and 29/11a8,
cites this line, writing:
虚無形謂之道.

[^xin-shu-shang-24]: The "Dao fa" 道法 section
of the Mawangdui *Jing fa*, 1, in speaking about the Way, states:
"Vacuous and formless,
its connecting thread is truly profound,
and it is that which gives life to all things."

[^xin-shu-shang-25]: Irregular rhyme:
道 (group 幽, 3rd tone) with
德 (group 之, 4th tone).

[^xin-shu-shang-26]: The meaning of
簡物小未一道 is not at all clear.
I have generally followed Yasui's interpretation.
Zhao Shouzheng has followed Guo Moruo,
who says 物 is balanced with 簡 and means "complex" as opposed to "simple."
He would also emend 未 to 大.
Thus Zhao would translate this sentence as
"What makes use of the Way
to equalize the simple and complex
and determines execution, extermination, prohibition, or punishment
is called law."

[^xin-shu-shang-27]: Emending 直, "straightforward,"
to 真 [Igai and Wang Niansun].

[^xin-shu-shang-28]: Reading 義 as 儀 [Zhang Peilun and Zhang Binglin].

[^xin-shu-shang-29]: Emending 顧 to 侧
in order to preserve the rhyme with 色 and 則 [Zhang Peilun].

[^xin-shu-shang-30]: Emending 伐 to 貸 [Yu Yue].
貸 (*t'əy*) rhymes with 側, 色, and 則 in the previous statement.
Thus, it is possible that this passage
should be included there rather than stand alone.

[^xin-shu-shang-31]: Irregular rhyme:
名 (group 耕) with
人 (group 真).

[^xin-shu-shang-32]: Following the interpretation
of the explanation (4b9; 65.7),
which adds 之言 after 不言 [Wang Niansun].

[^xin-shu-shang-33]: The Yang edition
mistakenly omits 始 [Zhang Peilun and Xu Weiyu].

[^xin-shu-shang-34]: Following the Yang edition
and Ming print of the Zhao edition,
both of which for *xiu* 休 write *chu* 怵.
The explanation (5a6; 65.12) also writes *chu*.
The Yin commentary originally wrote *xiu*.
(In the surviving Yang print
the commentary has been altered to read *chu* to conform with the text).
The Yin commentary explains *xiu* as meaning 止, "to cease" or "to halt."
Thus the phrase would read:
"The man of quality
is not to be deterred by something he likes."

[^xin-shu-shang-35]: Rhyme:
惡 (group 魚, 4th tone) with
故 (group 魚, 3rd tone).
According to Xu Weiyu,
故 should be read as 詐 (*tsray*, group 魚, 3rd tone).

[^xin-shu-shang-36]: This and the following sentence
are highly controversial since no mention of "art of the mind"
appears in the original statement.
As mentioned above, He Ruzhang and Guo Moruo would emend the statement
in accordance with the explanation here,
a suggestion I find unacceptable.
Wang Niansun, Zhang Wenhu, and Xu Weiyu would delete 故曰,
"Therefore it is said," from the beginning of this sentence,
but still the reference to "art of the mind" at this point
appears to be out of place.
Since this passage is so well known,
I have left it as is in the translation,
but I believe that, as it now stands, it either represents a marginal comment,
later inserted into the text by some early commentator
who was attempting to explain the meaning of the title,
or is the result of deliberate tampering as suggested by Zhang Peilun.
Zhang would delete both 故曰 and 術.
Thus: "The mind controls the apertures through nonassertiveness.
Therefore the statement refers to it as 'prince.'"

[^xin-shu-shang-37]: Emending the first 能 to 人 [Zhang Wenhu].

[^xin-shu-shang-38]: Emending 誠 to 試 [Zhang Wenhu].

[^xin-shu-shang-39]: I.e., your position.

[^xin-shu-shang-40]: The "Nei ye," 6b6-7 (104.7),
describes the spiritual force within the mind (靈氣在心) in similar terms:
"So fine that nothing can exist within it;
so large that nothing can exist beyond it."

[^xin-shu-shang-41]: Emending 世 to 也
in accordance with the original statement [Igai and Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-shang-42]: The use of *jing* 精 in this sentence presents a problem.
I have followed its usual translation in these _Xin shu_ chapters
of "essence" primarily because in explanation VII (3b10; 64.9)
there appears a somewhat similar combination of characters 職道之精,
"grasp the essence of the Way."
However, two other suggestions would appear to be as good or even better.
Yu Yue and Guo Moruo would emend *jing* 精 to *qing* 情.
Thus: "What men must control are their emotions."
The Jilin Sheng Zhexue Shehuikexue Yanjiusuo
and Zhao Shouzheng would interpret *jing*
in the same sense as it appears below in this paragraph.
Thus: "What men must grasp is singleness of purpose."

[^xin-shu-shang-43]: Guo Moruo would emend 宣 to 寡.
Thus: "the mind will be uncluttered."

[^xin-shu-shang-44]: Following the original statement,
which for 知,"knowledge," writes 智, both here and below.

[^xin-shu-shang-45]: Deleting 之 in accordance with
the original statement [Wang Niansun and Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-shang-46]: This sentence appears to be incomplete.
I have followed Wang Niansun by inserting 其所知 before 彼.

[^xin-shu-shang-47]: Deleting 曰, "it is said,"
since what follows is not contained in the original statement
and does not sound like an independent quotation.

[^xin-shu-shang-48]: Deleting 率 as a mistaken repetition of 奚 or 來.
The corresponding phrase that follows, 奚設, contains only two characters.

[^xin-shu-shang-49]: Emending 覆 to 復.
The final line of the chapter contains the phrase
復所於虚,
"he has returned to a state of vacuity" [Zhang Wenhu].

[^xin-shu-shang-50]: Reading 其 as 而
in accordance with the original statement [Xu Weiyu].

[^xin-shu-shang-rse-1]: Ctext uses U+27EB4 here,
which is missing from the font used here.
Ideographic structure is ⿺走午,
and since 赶 seems to be its equivalent,
I've replaced the ctext character here. --RSE

[^xin-shu-shang-51]: Emending 位 to 低
and reading 赶 as 啎
both here and in the following line [Wang Yinzhi].

[^xin-shu-shang-52]: Here we have a play on words:
"Power," 德 *de* (*tək*), and "obtainment," 得 *de* (*tək*).

[^xin-shu-shang-53]: The original text of this sentence is obviously corrupt.
I have followed Guo Moruo in emending
得也者其所得以然也
to
得也者謂得其所以然也.

[^xin-shu-shang-54]: Deleting 以 [Yu Yue and Dai Wang].

[^xin-shu-shang-55]: Emending 宜 to 道 [Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-shang-56]: Deleting 故, "therefore,"
at the beginning of thisr sentence [Xu Weiyu].

[^xin-shu-shang-57]: According to the "Dao fa" section
of the Mawangdui _Jing fa_, 1:
"The Way produced law."

[^xin-shu-shang-58]: Emending 莫 to 真 [Igai and Wang Niansun].

[^xin-shu-shang-59]: Emending 宜 to 俄 [Zhang Binglin and Zhang Peilun].

[^xin-shu-shang-60]: According to the _Huainanzi_, 14/12b10-11:
"The sage always puts himself last and never first.
He always responds (*ying* 應) but never raises his own voice.
He never pushes himself forward but is always seeking.
He never retreats but is always yielding."

[^xin-shu-shang-61]: Emending 顧 to 側 [Zhang Peilun].

[^xin-shu-shang-62]: According to the _Huainanzi_, 20/3b10-11:
"When bringing good order to the world,
the sage does not change the nature of people.
He makes them content with what they have
and purges them of their depravity.
Therefore relying on things as they are (*yin* 因) makes one great,
while attempting to transform them makes one small."

[^xin-shu-shang-63]: The Yang edition repeats 所.
I have followed Guo Moruo, who maintains that this obvious redundancy
is due to a miswriting of 取 (their forms are very similar in script).
The character 顧 is an interpolation taken from the text above
and should be deleted.

[^xin-shu-shang-64]: Emending 伐 to 貸 [Yu Yue].

[^xin-shu-shang-65]: Emending 闕 to 開
to conform with the original statement [Sun Xingyan, Yu Yue, and Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-shang-66]: Emending 過 to 惡 [Ding Shihan].
According to the _Hanfeizi_, II, 8/11a11-13 (Liao, _Han Fei Tzu_ 1:57):
"If you like [your subordinates], problems will multiply.
If you dislike them, resentments will arise.
Therefore, get rid of both likes and dislikes,
and make your vacuous mind the dwelling place of the Way."

[^xin-shu-shang-67]: Inserting 名 before 不 [Wang Niansun and Yasui].

[^xin-shu-shang-68]: Reading 姑 as 詁 [Guo Morno].

[^xin-shu-shang-69]: Deleting 應 as an interpolation
taken from the preceding passage [Wang Yinzhi and Xu Weiyu],

[^xin-shu-shang-70]: According to
the _Hanfeizi_, II, 8/9b4-6 (Liao, _Han Fei Tzu_ 1:54):
"When [the sage] does not know the name,
he returns to the form,
compares and identifies the form and name,
and utilizes what comes from this."

[^xin-shu-shang-71]: Emending 未 to 味 [Ding Shihan and Yao Yonggai].

[^xin-shu-shang-72]: Emending 君子, "man of quality" or "enlightened prince,"
to 有道之君,
in accordance with the text of the original statement.

[^xin-shu-shang-73]: Emending 矣 to 也 [He Ruzhang].
