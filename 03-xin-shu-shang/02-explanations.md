## [Explanation I]

<!-- commentary -->
心之在體
君之位也
"In the body, the mind
holds the position of prince.
九竅之有職
官之分也
The functions of the nine apertures
resemble the separate responsibilities of officials."
耳目者
視聽之官也
The ears and eyes
are the sense organs for seeing and hearing.
心而無與
視聽之事
則官得守其分矣
If the mind does not interfere with
the activities of seeing and hearing,
the sense organs will be able to maintain their separate functions.
夫心有欲者
物過而目不見
聲至而耳不聞也
Now if a person's mind is filled with desires,
his eyes will not see when things pass by,
nor will his ears hear when there are sounds.
故曰
Therefore the statement says:
上離其道
下失其事
"If the person on high departs from the Way,
those below will be lax in their work."
故曰
Hence it is said:
心術者
無為而制竅者也
"The art of the mind
lies in controlling the apertures through nonassertiveness."[^xin-shu-shang-36]
故曰君
Consequently, the statement refers to it as "prince."

if you are engaged in activity,
you cannot be observant.

謂其所立也
"Position"
refers to the place in which one stands.
人主者立於陰
The ruler of men stands in the Yin.

the Way is never apart from men,
