# Appendix: Introduction to the "Xin Shu Shang"

## Introductory Comments

"Xin shu shang" is another of the four so-called "Xin shu" 心術 chapters,
including
"Xin shu xia" 心術下 (XIII, 37),
"Bai xin" 白心 (XIII, 38),
and "Nei ye" 内業 (XVI, 49),
which modern Chinese scholars often lump together for study.
While all four of these chapters share some points in common,
particularly their emphasis on Daoist quietism and the prolongation of life,
their points of emphasis are quite different.
To facilitate a discussion of these differences
as well as of the opinions of various Chinese scholars
concerning the content and authorship,
I have rearranged the order in which these four chapters appear in the Guanzi,
placing the "Nei ye," which I believe to be the earliest of the four,
and its associated chapter, the "Xin shu xia,"
ahead of "Xin shu shang" and "Bai xin."

One of the distinctive features of this chapter is its format,
which differs greatly from that of the other three "Xin shu" texts.
It is divided into two separate parts:
the first, 1a7-2b6 (62.5-63.9),
consists of nineteen short statements,
largely in rhyme,
followed by a second part, 2b7-5b6 (63.9-66.4),
which presents relatively lengthy unrhymed explanations
for each of the statements except for number XIV.
This format is very similar to that of "Zhou he" 宙和 (IV, 11).

## Key Terms

Unlike the "Xin shu xia" or any of the other "Xin shu" chapters,
this chapter actually contains a reference to *xin shu*
in the explanation to statement I (3a1-2; 63.13),
and while I suspect that the particular passage involved
may be a later insertion,
it does provide an appropriate explanation for the title:
"The art of the mind
lies in controlling the apertures
(eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, and sex organ)
through nonassertiveness (*wu wei* 無為)."[^xin-shu-shang-1]

[^xin-shu-shang-1]: For a discussion of this passage, see n. 36, below.

The meaning and ideological background of the term *xin shu*
as well as that of other key terms used in this chapter, such as
*jing* 靜, "quiescence,"
and *Shen* 神, "the Spirit,"
have been dealt with in the introductory comments to the "Nei ye."
However, there are three other key Daoist terms
related to the mind that appear in "Xin shu shang"
but not in the other "Xin shu" chapters.
The first is *xu* 虚, "emptiness" or "vacuity."
According to statement VI,
"Wisdom!
Wisdom!
Cast it beyond the seas to avoid becoming its captive.
Those who seek it cannot compare with those who are vacuous.
Now the sage does not seek it.
Therefore he is able to be vacuous."[^xin-shu-shang-2]
What is vacuity?
It is not easy to define,
but the _Zhuangzi_, VIII, 23/4b11-5a7 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, p. 253)
provides a relevant passage:

[^xin-shu-shang-2]: According to the _Zhuangzi_,
V, 13/12a11 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 142):
"From vacuity comes quiescence;
from quiescence comes movement;
from movement comes attainment."
The _Laozi_, A, 16/8b6 (Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, 162),
also states:
"Attain the ultimate of vacuity;
maintain a true state of quiescence."

> Can you be compliant and simple?
Can you be a child?
A child will cry all day without becoming hoarse,
so perfect is its inner harmony.
It will close its fist all day without grasping anything in its hand,
so impartial is its Power.
It will stare all day without blinking,
so indifferent is it to what lies without.
It goes without knowing where
and rests without knowing why,
traipsing around with things,
riding along with them on the same wave.
This is the canon for preserving life.

Closely related to this passage is the _Laozi_, A, 10/5a9-b1
(Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, p. 153):
"By restraining your animal soul,
can you embrace the One without ever letting it go?
By concentrating your breath until it is soft,
can you become like a child?"
The _Huainanzi_, 12/14a4-5 (Morgan, _Tao the Great Luminant_, pp. 128-129),
explains this passage from the _Laozi_
by citing a story taken from
the _Zhuangzi_, III, 6/14b2-3 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_. p. 90),
concerning Yan Hui 顏回 "sitting in forgetfulness" (*zuo wang* 坐忘).
According to Yan Hui, sitting in forgetfulness involved
"tsevering connection with the limbs and body,
dispensing with the senses,
becoming detached from form,
rejecting knowledge,
and penetrating what transforms and pervades."
(For this last phrase the _Zhuangzi_ version writes:
"attaining unity with the Great Pervader (Da Tong 大通).

The other two terms are *yin* 因,
which normally has the meaning "to rely on"
but became a special Daoist term meaning
"to rely on things as they are,"
and *ying* 應,
which means "to be responsive"
or to "respond to things as they are."
According to the explanation for statement XIX:
"The Way values relying on things as they are.
'Relying on things as they are'
means relying on things' capabilities
when stating how they are to be used."
It goes on to say that when responding to things,
the prince who adheres to the Way appears to be at one with them.
That is,
"he fits himself to each occasion
like a shadow resembling a form
or an echo responding to a voice."

## Authorship and Dating

I have already discussed, in my introductory comments to the "Nei ye,"
Guo Moruo's contention that the nineteen statements of this chapter
are the work of Song Xing 宋餅, a Jixia 稷下 scholar
who preached a doctrine combining Daoism, Mohism, and Confucianism
at the end of the fourth and beginning of the third centuries B.C.,
while the explanations consist of notes taken by Song's students
during his lectures.[^xin-shu-shang-3]
I also indicated that I found Guo's thesis,
originally published in 1944,
unacceptable and that it had come under increasing criticism
by Chinese scholars in the 1980s.
One of the first scholars to present an alternative was Qiu Xigui, who,
in a 1980 study of the manuscripts appended to the Laozi "A" and "B" texts
found at Mawangdui,
attributed the authorship of "Xin shu shang, and "Bai xin"
to the school of two other Jixia scholars,
Shen Dao 慎到 and Tian Pian 田駢.[^xin-shu-shang-4]
Unfortunately, we know very little about these two men.
An existing text known as the _Shenzi_ 慎子
is attributed to a Shen Dao,
who is reputed to have come from the state of Zhao 趙
and lived sometime between 360 and 285 B.C.
The work itself has been carefully studied by P. M. Thompson,
who concludes that at least part of the text
may have been in existence as early as 240 B.C.,
but that there is no way of knowing
whether or not it really represents the thought of Shen Dao.[^xin-shu-shang-5]
The existing _Shenzi_ and the  fragments collected by Thompson
stress the importance of law,
of people being motivated by their own interests,
and of having a prince who stands aloof
and delegates administrative work to his ministers.
Brief descriptions of Shen Dao appear in other texts,
such as the _Xunzi_,
which states (III, 6/8b7-12; Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 1:223-224)
that Shen Dao and Tian Pian
"honored the principle of law, yet had no law."
Further along, the same text (XV, 21/3a13-3b1; Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 3:102)
adds that "Shenzi was blinded by law and insensible to worth."
The _Hanfeizi_, XVII, 40/1a (Liao, _Han Fei Tzu_ 2:199-200),
describes him as an advocate of strong government.

[^xin-shu-shang-3]: Guo, "Song Xing Yin Wen yizhu kao," 247.

[^xin-shu-shang-4]: Qiu Xigui,
"Mawangdui Laozi 'Jia Yi' ben juanqianhou yishu yu Daofajia," 80-83.
Qiu's views are also supported by Wu Guang,
"_Guanzi_ sipian yu Song-Yin xuepai bianxi," 42.
In a 1942 article, "_Kanshi_ no 'Shinjutsu' to Naigyō,'" 397-398,
the Japanese Sinologist Takeuchi Yoshio
also suggested a link between the "Xin shu shang" and Shen Dao.

[^xin-shu-shang-5]: The _Shen Tzu Fragments_, 174.
Thompson's work includes not only the surviving text
but also a large number of fragments to be found in other works.

About Tian Pian, we know even less
except that he is supposed to have been a native of Qi 齊
and to have produced a _Tianzi_ 田子 in twenty-five *pian*,
which disappeared after the Han.[^xin-shu-shang-6]
He is also mentioned in various pre-Han works,
including the _Lüshi chunqiu_, 17/17a4-9
(Wilhelm, _Frühling und Herbst_, p. 287),
which states that Tian Pian once instructed the King of Qi
on the art of the Way, saying:
"My words contain nothing about government,
yet through them one can attain government....
All transformations and reactions have a set form.
When relying on one's own nature
and trusting in other things,
there is no one who will not find what is suitable and proper."

[^xin-shu-shang-6]: _Qian-Han shu_, 30/17a1.
Thompson, _The Shen Tzu Fragments_, 272,
cites another source giving fifteen *pian*.
Zhou Ying, in his, "Tian Pian yizhu kaozheng ji qi sixiang yanjiu,"
believes that seven chapters of the present _Guanzi_
are lost works of Tian Pian:
IX, 23;
X, 30;
XI, 31;
XV, 45;
XV, 46;
XV, 47;
and XV, 48.

The _Shi ji_, 74/2-6,
lists Shen Dao and Tian Pian as being among those who
"studied the methods of Huang-Lao 黃老 Daoism."
However, the fullest description of these two men
is contained in the _Zhuangzi_, X, 33/17a7-18b6
(Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, pp. 369-371),
which lumps Shen Dao and Tian Pian together with Peng Meng 彭蒙,
another Daoist participant in the Jixia Academy:

> To be impartial and nonpartisan,
easy-going and unselfish,
decisive but not obstinate,
compliant but not two-faced,
unconcerned with worries, 
unscheming in knowledge,
indiscriminate in one's choice of things
but going along with all of them---such
was the method of the Way as practiced in ancient times.
Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard about these models for behavior
and were delighted with them.
They took as foremost the equality of all things, saying,
"Heaven is able to cover but not support;
Earth is able to support but not cover.
The Great Way is able to embrace all things
but not discriminate among them."
They knew that all things had that which they could do
and that which they could not do.
Therefore they said:
"Selection results in exclusion;
instruction results in being incomplete.
The Way omits nothing."
For this reason Shen Dao discarded knowledge, 
rejected self,
followed necessity,
and was indifferent to things,
taking this as the principle of the Way.
He said: "True knowledge is not to know."
He despised knowledge and worked to destroy it....
It was the same with Tian Pian.
He studied with Peng Meng and learned about teaching nothing from him.

From what we are able to glean from the _Shenzi_
and these other bits and pieces of information about Shen Dao and Tian Pian,
it appears possible that the "Bai xin" chapter
may be connected with their school of thought,
but I do not think this is the case with this chapter.[^xin-shu-shang-7]
Law is dealt with in statement IX and its explanation,
but it is only a minor issue in the context of the whole work.
Ridding oneself of desires,
a very important concept here is not mentioned in the _Shenzi_
or other sources for Shen Dao and Tian Pian.
Furthermore, key Daoist concepts such as
*jing*, "quiescence,"
*xu*, "vacuity,
*yin*, "relying on things as they are,"
and *ying*, "responding to things as they are,"
which are stressed in this chapter, 
do not even appear in the _Shenzi_.

[^xin-shu-shang-7]: Possible relationships with the "Bai xin" chapter
will be dealt with in its introductory comments.

I also find it difficult to accept Guo's contention
that the statements of this chapter constitute a lecture outline
of a master and the explanations as notes taken by his students,
since it appears certain that the explanations were written
long after the original statements.[^xin-shu-shang-8]
Terseness of style and general ideological content
indicate that the statements could be the work of a Jixia scholar
or scholars living during the early third century B.C.,
as most modern Chinese scholars believe.
However, it is impossible to tell
whether or not they came from a single source.
There is wide variety among them in terms of form.
Some are full paragraphs,
while others are made up of only one or two lines.
Some appear to be catchy apothegms or popular sayings,
such as statement II,
while others are well-developed arguments.
Most are in rhyme,
but statements VI, VIII, IX, X, XVIII, and XIX are not.
They could be the jottings, perhaps a lecture outline,
of a single individual or fragments lifted from a single work,
but it is also possible that they are
fragments taken from a variety of sources,
as in the case of
the "Xing shi" 形勢 (I, 2)
and "Zhou he" 宙和 (IV, 11) chapters.[^xin-shu-shang-9]
Given the fact that the statements in this chapter
tend to have a more logical relationship with each other
than those appearing in either the "Xing shi" or the "Zhou he,"
perhaps a single-source option makes more sense.

[^xin-shu-shang-8]: Both Kanaya Osamu, _Kanshi no kenkyū_, 334,
and Harold Roth, "Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism," 16,
have expressed similar views.

[^xin-shu-shang-9]: The major difference in the case of the "Xing shi"
is that the explanations for its statements
appear in a separate chapter (XX, 64),
while in the case of this chapter and "Zhou he,"
the explanations are included in the same chapter.
This may be due to the fact that these latter texts are rather short.

In any case, I believe that they represent
the work of a person or persons
who originally came from the linguistic area dominated by Chu,
since the four examples of irregular rhymes
that appear in the statements
similar to those appearing in the _Laozi_.[^xin-shu-shang-10]
I also believe that the statements postdate the "Nei ye"
and reflect the influence of "Nei ye" thinking,
particularly in regard to its stress on the interaction of mind and body
and the need to rid oneself of desires and cleanse the mind
so that the Spirit will remain.
However, the "Xin shu shang" is much more political in tone,
reflecting the development of Huang-Lao thinking
with its incorporation into a predominantly Daoist ideology
a stress on law (*fa* 法),
forms (*xing* 形)
and names (*ming* 名),
and Confucian virtues.[^xin-shu-shang-11]
Furthermore, the "Xin shu shang" makes use of Daoist terms
such as *xu*, "vacuity,"
*yin*, "relying on things as they are,"
and *ying*, "responding to things as they are,"
which do not appear in the "Nei ye."

[^xin-shu-shang-10]: I.e., group 之 rhyming with group 幽
and group 真 rhyming with group 耕.
For a discussion of these rhymes,
see my introductory comments to the "Nei ye."

[^xin-shu-shang-11]: For a discussion of Huang-Lao thought,
see my introductory comments to the "Nei ye."
The "Nei ye" also refers to Confucian virtues in stanza XIII,
but, as mentioned in my notes,
this could be a later addition to that text.

The explanations, furthermore, appear to be even later.
Not only is the style quite different,
being much more expansive
and thus resembling that common to the later period,
but the reference to Yin-Yang,
which appears in explanation III
but nowhere else in these four "Xin shu" texts,
indicates that the explanations could not date
before the middle of the third century B.C.,
when Yin-Yang dualism first began to achieve wide popularity
in terms of political theory.[^xin-shu-shang-12]
Therefore it would appear that the statements were gathered together
by some later writer who explicated and elaborated on them.
Who could such a person have been?
The fact that this chapter and "Xin shu xia" share a common title
would seem to indicate that at least at one point
they shared a common history.
I have already expressed my opinion
in the introductory comments to the "Nei ye"
that the "Xin shu xia" probably was the product of scholars
at the court of Huainan 淮南,
where scholars serving the king, Liu An 劉安,
devoted great effort to collecting remnants of Chu 楚 tradition
and producing works with a Daoist or Huang-Lao orientation.
Therefore I believe that this text also was put together in its present form
by these same Huainan scholars
and that it became part of those Huainan library materials that,
after the death of Liu An in 122 B.C.,
were transferred to the imperial library in Chang'an 長安,
where they eventually came into the iiands of Liu Xiang 劉向,
who put together our present _Guanzi_ about 26 B.C.

[^xin-shu-shang-12]: For a discussion of Yin-Yang dualism
in relation to these texts,
see my introductory comments to the "Nei ye."
