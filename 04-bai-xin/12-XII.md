## [XII]

<!-- commentary -->
道之大如天
其廣如地
其重如石
其輕如羽
The Way is vast like Heaven,
broad like Earth,
heavy like stone,
and light like a feather.
民之所以
知者寡
It is something all people use,
but few understand.
故曰
Therefore it is said:

何道之近
而莫之與能服也
How can the Way be so close,
and yet there be no one[^bai-xin-72] able to apply it? (服 *bjwək*)

棄近
而就遠
何以費力也
Why do people,
by ignoring its immediate presence
and seeking it afar,
continue to waste their energy? (力 *liək*)

<!-- commentary -->
故曰
Therefore I say:

欲愛吾身
先知吾情
If I wish to care for my body,
I must first come to understand my inner reality. (*dzjieng*)[^bai-xin-73]

君親六合
以考內身
For this,
I must observe everything[^bai-xin-74] within the six directions
as a basis for examining what lies within the self. (*st'jien*)

以此
知象
乃知
行情
Having, in such a way,
come to recognize my personal qualities,
I may then come to understand
how to manage my inner reality. (情 *dzjieng*)

既知行情
乃知
養生
When one understands how to manage one's inner reality,
one may then come to understand
how to nurture one's life. (生 *sreng*)

左右
前後
周而復所
Turn[^bai-xin-75] to left and right,
before and behind,
and return to the original position. (所 *siay*)

執儀
服象
敬迎來者
Hold fast to discipline,
suppress your personal qualities,
and respectfully welcome whatever comes. (者 *tjiay*)

今夫來者
必道其道
Now whatever comes,
you must be certain to follow the proper way. (道 *dəw*)

無頡
無衍
命乃長久
Do not change
or add to it,
and your life then will be preserved for a long time. (久 *kjwəg*)[^bai-xin-76]

和
以反中
形性
相葆
Keep yourself in harmony
in order to return to the mean,
and your form and basic nature
will then nurture each other. (葆 *pəw*)

一
以無貳
是謂知道
Concentrate your mind
and never divide your attention---
such is called coming to know the Way. (道 *dəw*)

將欲服之
必一其端
而固其所守
Should you wish to suppress [your personal qualities],
you must concentrate[^bai-xin-77] on fundamental feelings[^bai-xin-78]
and be steadfast in preserving them. (守 *st'jew*)[^bai-xin-79]

責其往來
We seek its going and coming, (來 *ləy*)

莫知其時
But no one can tell when this will be. (時 *djiəy*)

索之於天
與之為期
We must search for its signs in Heaven
to discover its natural time of arrival. (期 *kiəy*)

不失其期
乃能得之
By grasping its natural time of arrival,
we will then be able to succeed. (*tjiəy*)

故曰
Therefore I say:
吾語若大明之極
"My words are like the quintessence of the Great Brilliance.[^bai-xin-80]
大明之明
非愛人
不予也
The brilliance of the Great Brilliance
is not concealed from men,
it is just that they are not prepared for it.[^bai-xin-81]
同
則相從
If a person is in accord with the Great Brilliance,
it will come of itself.
反
則相距也
If a person is not in accord with the Great Brilliance,
it stays away."
吾察反
則相距
I have investigated
this "not being in accord"
and the resulting "staying away."
吾以故知
古從之同也
Therefore, I understand
how the ancients brought themselves into accord with the Great Brilliance.[^bai-xin-82]
