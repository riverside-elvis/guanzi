[^bai-xin-rse-1]: I've arranged the first five phrases
of the ctext base text
to accord with Rickett's translation,
but otherwise I've left them as they appear in ctext. --RSE

[^bai-xin-6]: The first line of this paragraph,
建當立有,
makes no sense.
He Ruzhang, Zhang Peilun, and Guo Moruo
would emend 當 to 常
and 立 to 无 = 無
in accordance with _Zhuangzi_, X, 33/18b8-9 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 372):
建之以常無有,
主之以太一,
"They established [standards in terms of] constant being and non-being
and took the Great Unity as their central concept."
Thus it would read:
"Establish constant standards in terms of non-being and being."
However, concepts of non-being and being play no part in this chapter.
Furthermore such an emendation would make the rhyme pattern quite irregular.
Wang Niansun would emend
當 to 常
and 有 to 首 = 道,
interpreting it to mean:
"Establish constant standards and set forth the Way."
While this preserves the rhyme, it destroys the meter.
Therefore, I have followed Tao Hongqing and Xu Weiyu,
who agree with Wang Niansun in emending
當 to 常 and 有 to 首 = 道,
but, in accordance with the general sequence of ideas
as presented in the next paragraph,
would reorder the lines of this paragraph to read:
以靖為宗,
以時為寶,
以正為儀,
建常立道,
和則能久.

[^bai-xin-7]: Reading *zheng* 政 as *zheng* 正 [Wang Niansun].

[^bai-xin-8]: Emending 當 to 常 [Wang Niansun].

[^bai-xin-9]: Irregular rhyme:
取 (group 侯) with 道 (group 幽), above.

[^bai-xin-10]: According to the _Huainanzi_, 14/12b 10-11:
"The sage is always behind and never to the fore;
always responds and never leads (唱 = 倡);
never advances, yet seeks;
never retreats, yet yields."

[^bai-xin-11]: Emending 隨 to 堕 [Wang Niansun and Igai].
Irregular rhyme:
堕 (group 歌) with 廢 (group 祭), above.
This is an uncommon pattern,
but the meter appears to call for it.

[^bai-xin-12]: Emending *xing* 形, "form," to *xing* 性.
The Yang edition writes *xing* 刑, "punishment."

[^bai-xin-13]: Deleting 明君 before 聖人
as a later interpolation [Ding Shiiian].

[^bai-xin-14]: Emending 既誇 to 百姓
in order to preserve the balance with the preceding sentence.
Yin Tongyang would read 均既 as 均概.
Thus: "For this reason,
all things are treated equally and allowed to proliferate."

[^bai-xin-15]: Deleting 自治 as an interpolation
taken from the following line [Tao Hongqing].

[^bai-xin-16]: Emending 奇身名廢 to 奇名自廢 [Wang Niansun]
and inserting 之 after 廢 in order to complete the rhyme.
The passage IV, 12/13a 1-2 (1:57.1) states:
"If terms (names) are correctly adhered to,
there will be good order;
when they are distorted,
disorder prevails.
If there is no terminology at all,
death ensues."
The "Lun" 論 section of the Mawangdui _Jing fa_ text (p. 29)
contains a similar statement.

[^bai-xin-rse-2]: I've arranged this and the next stanza
of the ctext base text
to accord with Rickett's translation. --RSE

[^bai-xin-17]: Irregular rhyme:
度 (group 魚) with 事 (group 之), above.

[^bai-xin-18]: Inverting the order of these final two sentences:
刼有所餘,
有所不足,
and
大者宽,
小者局.

[^bai-xin-19]: Rhyme:
局 (group 侯, 4th tone) with
足 (group 侯, 3rd tone), above.

[^bai-xin-20]: These two sentences,
9b12 (70.3) and 10a1 (70.4),
左者出者也,
右者入者也, 
出者而不傷人,
入者而自傷也,
which are clearly out of place,
probably belong here.
I have also followed the Ancient, Liu, and Zhu editions,
which add 而 before 自.

[^bai-xin-21]: Yin Zhizhang would equate the left with Yang, governing life,
and the right with Yin, governing death.
Guo Moruo believes they concern military affairs,
the left being equated with defense
and the right with offense.
He explains that the shield
is held in the left hand in front of the body (outward),
while weapons such as the sword and lance
are held in the right hand behind (inward).

[^bai-xin-22]: The following sentence, 10a7 (70.7),
審量出入而觀物所載,
also appears to be misplaced and probably belongs here.

[^bai-xin-23]: Gui 鬼 usually refers to the spirits of the dead,
and therefore does not seem appropriate here.
A similar passage, 11b11 (71.13), for *gui* writes *shen* 神,
which refers to spirits in general
and thus would appear to be a more appropriate reading.
However, the rhyme pattern there
indicates that the *shen* should be emended to *gui*.
Wang Yinzhi explains that *gui* and *shen*
are sometimes used interchangeably.

[^bai-xin-24]: Emending 義 to 者,
both here and in the following line [Ding Shihan].

[^bai-xin-25]: Yin Zhizhang has a different interpretation,
explaining that humility leads to strength,
which in turn, leads to arrogance.

[^bai-xin-26]: Cf. XV, 42/2b4-5 (2:86.8-9):
"Those who grasp a little are benefited some;
those who grasp a great deal are benefited greatly.
Those who carry it out to the full will possess the entire realm."

[^bai-xin-27]: The following short passage,
左者出者也,
右者入者也,
出者而不傷人,
入者而自傷也,
appears to be a misplaced slip,
which I have moved to 9b2 (69.12).

[^bai-xin-28]: Cf. the "Nei ye," 5a2 (103.1),
and "Xin shu xia," 6a11 (66.14):
能毋(無)卜筮
而知凶吉乎,
"Without resorting to tortoise shell and milfoil,
can you foretell bad fortune from good?"
The _Hanfeizi_, V, 15/1a10 (Liao, _Han Fei Tzu_ 1:134),
when listing portents of ruin, states:
"[If the ruler] indulges in selecting lucky days,
worships spirits,
trusts in divination by tortoise shell and milfoil,
and seeks enjoyment from sacrificial feasts,
ruin is possible."
The _Huainanzi_, 8/1a11-13 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, 80),
also states that in the time of great purity,
"there was no recourse to the selection of lucky days,
the casting of lots,
or divination using trigrams."

[^bai-xin-29]: The Yang edition writes 刑, "punishments,"
for 形, "form" or "body."
Guo Moruo would follow the Yang edition
since he believes that the discussion
is primarily dealing with military affairs.

[^bai-xin-30]: Xu Weiyu would emend 去 to 出
in accordance with the "Appended Treatise A" 繫辭
of the _Yi jing_, VII, 6/5b5-6 (Wilhelm, _I Ching_ 1:328):
"The Master said,
'The man of quality remains within his room.
If the words he speaks are well spoken (出其言善),
then from even beyond a thousand *li*,
people will respond to them.'"
Thus this sentence would read:
"The words he speaks are well spoken;
the deeds he performs are well done."

[^bai-xin-31]: The Yang edition mistakenly writes 口 for 名.

[^bai-xin-32]: The following sentence,
審量出入而觀物所載,
is clearly out of place.
I have transferred it to 9b2 (69.12).

[^bai-xin-33]: Emending 法 to 治, both here and below [Guo Moruo].

[^bai-xin-34]: Following Guo Moruo in emending 弱 (*njawk*), "weak,"
here and at the end of the sentence,
to 躬 in order to preserve the rhyme.

[^bai-xin-35]: Emending 有 to 不 [Yu Yue and Dai Wang].

[^bai-xin-36]: Wang Niansun would emend
有中有中 to 中有有中.
Thus: "Within the center there is another center."
This would accord with a somewhat similar statement
appearing in the "Nei ye," 3b11 (101.140):
心之中又有心,
"Within the mind there is another mind."

[^bai-xin-37]: These two quotations
are very similar to the _Zhuangzi_,
VII, 20/11b9-10 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 214):
"I once heard a man of great accomplishments say,
'Those given to boasting will have no success.
Success once achieved may be destroyed;
fame once achieved may be lost.
Who can rid himself of success and fame
and return to join the masses of men?'"

[^bai-xin-38]: The meaning of this and the following sentence
is not at all clear.
I have followed Wang Niansun,
who would emend the first sentence,
有成無貴其成也,
to read
無成貴其有成也,
in accordance with the phraseology of the following sentence.
Guo Moruo, on the other hand,
would leave the first sentence as is
and emend the second sentence,
有成貴其無成也,
to read
有成無貴其成也. 
Thus: "Having no accomplishments is honored as an accomplishment.
Having accomplishments is not honored as an accomplishment."

[^bai-xin-39]: The Yang edition for
己無已 writes 已無已.
I have followed Wang Niansun and Yasui,
who would read 已 as 己
and interpret the sentence in accordance with the Yin Zhizhang commentary,
emending 無 to 亡 = 忘.

[^bai-xin-40]: Reading 淑 as 寂 [Li Zheming and Yin Tongyang].

[^bai-xin-41]: According to the _Zhou li_,
12/8b7 (Biot, _Tcheou-li_ 1:265),
"One uses the thunder drum to announce sacrifices to the spirits."
The accompanying Zheng Xuan 鄭玄 commentary
describes a thunder drum as having eight sides.

[^bai-xin-42]: The Yang edition and Ming (1582) print of the Zhao edition 
mistakenly write □¹for □², an old form of 搖.
The Zhejiang Shuju 浙江書局 (1876),
and _SBBY_ versions of the Zhao edition both write □².
[I can't find either missing character. --RSE]

[^bai-xin-43]: Irregular rhyme:
聞 (group 文) with 見, above,
and 滿 , below, (group 元). 

[^bai-xin-44]: Emending the two phrases
集於顏色,
如於肌膚
to
集於肌膚,
如於顏色
[Wang Niansun and Xu Weiyu].

[^bai-xin-45]: Irregular rhyme:
膚 (group 魚, 1st tone) with
塞 (group 之, 3rd tone), above, and
色 (group 之, 4th tone), below.

[^bai-xin-46]: Irregular rhymes:
圜 (group 元) with
方 (group 陽), above, and
門 ( group 文), below.
Cf. a similar statement concerning the thoughts of a sage
in IV, 12/11b7 (1:55.14).

[^bai-xin-47]: Reading 比 as 庇 [Zhao Shouzheng].

[^bai-xin-48]: Irregular rhyme:
東 (group 東) with
鄉 (group 陽). 

[^bai-xin-49]: Irregular rhyme:
貞 (group 耕) with
人 (group 真), below.
Zhang Wenhu and Xu Weiyu would emend
貞 (*tieng*) to 真 (*tjien*, group 真), "true,"
in order to preserve the rhyme with 人.

[^bai-xin-50]: This statement is reminiscent of
the story in the _Zhuangzi_,
V, 13/18a 13-18b13 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 152-153),
in which Wheelwright Pian
criticizes Duke Huan of Qi
for reading a book:
"When the men of old died
they took with them things that couldn't be handed down.
So what you are reading
must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old."

[^bai-xin-51]: Irregular rhyme:
指 (group 脂, 2nd tone) with
習 (group 緝, 4th tone), above.
This pattern, however, is rather uncommon.

[^bai-xin-52]: Emending 其 to 於 in accordance with
the Ancient, Liu, and Zhu editions
and the slightly different version of this quotation
appearing earlier in the chapter, 9b3-4 (69.13) [Yasui and Wang Yinzhi].

[^bai-xin-53]: Emending 神 (*zdjien*) to 鬼 (*kjwər*)
in accordance with the the slightly different version of this quotation
mentioned above [Wang Yinzhi and Guo Moruo].
鬼 (group 微) forms an irregular rhyme with
水 (group 脂).

[^bai-xin-54]: The text here is somewhat garbled.
Most of the commentators agree as to its basic meaning,
but I have followed the specific suggestions of Wang Yinzhi,
emending
事有適而無適,
若有適觿解不可解而后解
to
事有通,
無適而后適,
解有觿,
不可解而后解.

[^bai-xin-55]: Inserting 於名 (*mjieng*) after 毋提提
in order to complete the rhyme with 刑 (*geng*), below [Zhang Peilun].

[^bai-xin-56]: According to the Yin Zhizhang commentary,
the left represents the Yang and is good;
the right represents the Yin and is bad.

[^bai-xin-57]: Reading 愕愕 as 落落, here and below [Guo Moruo].

[^bai-xin-58]: Reading 莢 as 慝 = 快 [Yu Yue and Guo Moruo].

[^bai-xin-59]: Emending 近 to 迺 = 乃 [Guo Moruo].

[^bai-xin-60]: The character 周 (*tjəw*)
at the end of this sentence makes little sense
and destroys the rhyme.
Yu Yue and Zhao Shouzheng would emend it to 君 (*kjwən*), "prince."
While this makes sense in terms of meaning,
it fails to solve the rhyme problem.
Therefore I have followed Guo Moruo
in emending it to 啻 = 帝,
even though the word seems a little out of place in this chapter.

[^bai-xin-61]: Inverting 長久 to 久長
in order to preserve the rhyme pattern [Zhang Wenhu].

[^bai-xin-62]: Emending 四璧 to 四辟 (闢),
lit., the four openings [Ding Shihan and Zhang Peilun].

[^bai-xin-63]: Emending 請 to 情 [Ding Shihan].

[^bai-xin-64]: According to the _Zhuangzi_,
VI, 17/10al12-13 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 181):
"Emperors and kings had different ways of abdicating their thrones;
the three dynasties had different rules of succession.
Those who went against the times and flouted custom
were called usurpers;
those who accorded with the times and adhered to custom
were called companions of righteousness."
The text then goes on to say:
"From the point of view of the Way,
what is noble or what is mean?
These are called ebb and flow."

[^bai-xin-65]: According to the _Shang shu dazhuan_ (_SBCK edition_), 3/1b9-10:
"When King Wu attacked Zhou 紂 [of the Shang],
on reaching the suburbs of the Shang capital,
he stopped to rest for the night.
The troops were all delighted,
singing and dancing while waiting for the dawn."

[^bai-xin-66]: Guo Moruo would emend 臥名 to 頤名
in order to preserve syntactic balance with the two preceding lines.
Thus, "As one becomes skilled in argument,
one's life is placed in peril."

[^bai-xin-67]: The six directions (*liu he* 六合)
are north, south, east, west, above, and below.

[^bai-xin-68]: Emending 進 to 遂 [Zhang Peilun and Xu Weiyu]
in accordance with a similar statement in
the Heshanggong 河上公 (_SBCK_) edition of the _Laozi_, A, 9/4b6:
功成名遂身退,
天之道,
"To accomplish one's tasks, achieve fame, and then withdraw
is the way of Heaven."
The Wang 王弼 (_SBBY_) edition,
A, 9/5a (Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, 152), writes:
功遂身退,
天之道,
"To accomplish one's tasks and then with­draw is the way of Heaven."
The _Laozi_. "A" and "B" texts (_Wenwu_, 1974, no. 11: 12, 18)
concur with the Wang Bi version.

[^bai-xin-69]: Irregular rhyme:
道 (group 幽) with 已 (group 之), above.

[^bai-xin-70]: Irregular rhyme:
交 (group 宵) with 子 (group 之), above.
A close parallel to these three lines
is to be found in the Mawangdui _Cheng_ text, 90.
[This footnote is a duplicate of footnote 71, below,
and appears to be an error in the original text. --RSE]

[^bai-xin-71]: Irregular rhyme:
交 (group 宵) with 子 (group 之), above.
A close parallel to these three lines
is to be found in the Mawangdui _Cheng_ text, 90.

[^bai-xin-72]: Deleting 與 in accordance with
the Ancient edition [Yasui, Xu Weiyu, and Guo Moruo].

[^bai-xin-73]: For a discussion of *qing* 情
and other terms appearing in this paragraph,
see my introductory comments.

[^bai-xin-74]: Emending 君親 to 周視
in accordance with the Yin Zhizhang commentary [Yu Yue and Xu Weiyu].

[^bai-xin-75]: The following paragraph
appears to be a discussion of some form of yoga practice,
but the text is extremely difficult to interpret
since we know so little about the method involved.

[^bai-xin-76]: Irregular rhyme:
久 (group 之) with
道 (group 幽), above.

[^bai-xin-77]: The Yang edition mistakenly omits 一 after 必 [Guo Moruo].

[^bai-xin-78]: The meaning of *duan* 端,
which I have translated here as "fundamental feelings,"
is not entirely clear.
I have based my translation on the _Mengzi_, IIA, 6/5-7,
which speaks of the four *duan* or feelings,
which are the beginnings of virtue:
"The feeling of commiseration is the beginning of humaneness.
The feeling of shame and dislike is the beginning of righteousness.
The feeling of modesty and yielding is the beginning of propriety.
A sense of right and wrong is the beginning of wisdom."
However, it is also possible that what is being referred to here
is a primal breath.
Thus this sentence might read:
"Should you wish to suppress [your personal qualities],
you must concentrate the primal breath and be steadfast in preserving it."

[^bai-xin-79]: Rhyme:
守 (group 幽, 2nd tone) with
道 (group 幽, 3rd tone), above.

[^bai-xin-80]: The Yin Zhizhang commentary
explains the "Great Brilliance" 大明 as Heaven.
It may refer to a specific heavenly body.
Yasui says it refers to the Way.

[^bai-xin-81]: keading 愛 as 薆 and 予 as 豫 [Guo Moruo].

[^bai-xin-82]: Following Ding Shihan and Yao Yonggai,
who would invert 從之 to read 之從.
Guo Moruo would emend 古 to 同.
Accordingly:
"Therefore, I understand the meaning of 'being in accord.'"
