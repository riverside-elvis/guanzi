## [XI]

天之視
而精
Through the observation of Heaven,
discover your vital essence. (精 *tsjieng*)

四璧而
知請
Through the movement of the four seasons,[^bai-xin-62]
come to know your inner reality. (請 *dzjieng*)[^bai-xin-63]

壤土
而與生
Through the rich earth,
find sustenance for your life. (生 *sreng*)

<!-- commentary -->
能若夫風與波乎
唯其所欲適
Can you be like the wind and waves,
desiring only what is appropriate to the circumstances?

<!-- commentary -->
故子而代其父
曰義也
Now when a son takes the place of his father,
he is said to be righteous;
臣而代其君
曰篡也
when a minister takes the place of his prince,
he is said to be rebellious.[^bai-xin-64]
篡何能歌
How can rebellion be praised in song?
武王是也
King Wu was an example of this.[^bai-xin-65]

<!-- commentary -->
故曰
Therefore it is said:

庸能
去辯與巧
Who is it that is able
to dispense with bickering and trickery (巧 *krəw*)

而還與眾人
同道
And return to sharing with ordinary men
the same road? (道 *dəw*)

<!-- commentary -->
故曰
And again:
思索精者
明益衰
"As thought and inquiry are refined,
their brilliance increasingly declines;
德行修者
王道狹
as virtuous conduct is cultivated,
the kingly way becomes more narrowly circumscribed;
臥名利者
寫生危
as one becomes content with fame and profit,[^bai-xin-66]
one's life is placed in peril."
知
周於六合之內者
吾知生之有為阻也
I know that
once my knowledge
has come to encompass all within the six directions,[^bai-xin-67]
my life will be beset by obstacles.

持
而滿之
乃其殆也
To grasp life
and live it to the full
will then be fraught with danger. (殆 *dəy*)

名滿於天下
不若其已也
Before one's fame has spread throughout the realm,
it is best to stop. (已 *riəy*)

名進
而身退
天之道也
To achieve fame[^bai-xin-68]
and then withdraw
is Heaven's way. (道 *dəw*)[^bai-xin-69]

滿盛之國
不可以仕任
In a state that has reached its peak,
one should never accept office. (仕 *dziəy*)[^bai-xin-70]

滿盛之家
不可以嫁子
Into a family that has reached its peak,
one should never marry one's daughter. (子 *tsjiəy*)

驕倨傲暴之人
不可與交
With men who are arrogant and domineering,
one should never associate. (交 *kraw*)[^bai-xin-71]
