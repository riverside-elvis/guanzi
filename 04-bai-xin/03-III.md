## [III]

兵之出
出於人
When armed forces are sent forth,
they will be directed against others. (人 *njien*)

其人入
入於身
But when the others counterattack,
they will be directed against oneself. (身 *st'jien*)

<!-- commentary -->
左者出者也
右者入者也
\[The left[^bai-xin-20] reaches out;
the right reaches in.
出者而不傷人
入者自傷也
What reaches outward is not harmful to others,
but what reaches inward is harmful to the self.[^bai-xin-21]\]
審量出入
而觀物所載
\[Make[^bai-xin-22] careful assessments
of what goes out and what comes in
and keep your eyes on the fitness of things.\]
兵之勝
從於適
Victory in arms
is derived from suitable situations;
德之來
從於身
virtue
is derived from one's self.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
祥於鬼者
義於人
兵不義不可
"Whoever is blessed by the spirits[^bai-xin-23]
must be righteous in his conduct toward others,
and the armed forces must be used in a righteous manner."

強而驕者
損其強
Those who are strong but arrogant,
destroy their strength; (強 *gjang*)

弱而驕者
前死亡
Those who are weak but arrogant,
hasten toward death and ruin. (亡 *mjwang*)

<!-- commentary -->
強而卑義
信其強
Being strong but humble[^bai-xin-24]
expands one's strength.
弱而卑義
免於罪
Being weak but humble
keeps one from offending others.
是故
驕之餘卑
卑之餘驕
For this reason,
too much arrogance leads to humility,
too much humility leads to arrogance [on the part of others].[^bai-xin-25]
