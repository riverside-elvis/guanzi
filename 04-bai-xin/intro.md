# Appendix: Introduction to the "Bai Xin"

## Introductory Comments

"Bai xin" is one of the major Daoist Huang-Lao 黃老 chapters in the _Guanzi_
and is often lumped together by modern Chinese scholars with
"Xin shu shang" 心術上 (XIII, 36),
"Xin shu xia" 心術下 (XIII, 37),
and "Nei ye" 内業 (XVI, 49),
as one of the four so-called "Xin shu" 心術 chapters.
However, it is a totally independent work,
written in essay form and differing greatly in content and style
from the other "Xin shu" chapters.
It is also one of the more difficult chapters in the _Guanzi_
since not only does it contain numerous corrupt passages,
but the subject is often extremely abstruse.

Dealing primarily with the Daoist sage ruler,
the chapter readily divides itself into twelve sections or arguments,
which, even though independent of one another,
as is the case in other "Xin shu" chapters,
nevertheless present a complete sequence of ideas.
In terms of content, the chapter emphasizes
quiescence,
adherence to the Way,
the avoidance of worldly success and fame,
the rejection of worldly knowledge,
and the prolonging of life
through understanding the self and care for one's body.
Such prolonging or nurturing of life (*yang sheng* 養生)
includes the practice of a yoga discipline,
which would appear to be of a rather advanced type,
but for which, unfortunately, the text (13b 1-12; 73.5-11)
provides only a very vague description.

It does, however, provide further information
concerning the psychological preconditions necessary for meditation
and other aspects of yoga discipline to be effective.
Accordingly the text states:
"If I wish to care for my body,
I must first come to understand my inner reality (*qing* 情)."
It goes on to explain that to do this one must observe
everything within the six directions
as a basis for examining what lies within the self.
This in turn will lead one to an understanding
of one's personal qualities (*xiang* 象),
and from there,
to an understanding of how to manage one's inner reality.
*Qing*, "inner reality,"
is a term that stands in contrast to another term,
*xing* 性, "the fundamental or basic nature of things."
The former is more comprehensive,
includes the emotions,
and generally can be said to be
that nature which can be shaped or modified by training or environment.
*Xing*, on the other hand,
consists entirely of inborn characteristics or potentials
that may be developed but that are only slightly,
if at all, subject to modification.
In other words, to eat is *xing*;
to be a glutton is *qing*.
*Xiang*, originally a pictograph of an elephant,
came at an early date to mean
"to resemble,"
or, as a noun,
"appearance," "image," or "symbol."
In II, 6/1b7-11 (1:22.12-13),
it refers to "physical qualites"
and constitutes one of the "seven standards" (*qi fa* 七法)
that give the chapter its name.
These "physical qualities" include
bearing (*yi* 義),
designation (*ming* 名),
position in time (*shi* 時),
similarity (*si* 似),
classification (*lei* 類),
comparability (*bi* 比),
and shape by which things are defined and recognized (*zhuang* 狀).
As the text (2a11; 23.5-6) says:
"Hoping to grade materials and investigate their usage
while remaining ignorant of physical qualities
would be like cutting off what is naturally long to make it short
or stretching something that is naturally short to make it long."
In this chapter, *xiang* refers to those personal qualities,
emotional and intellectual,
that represent and define the individual self.

The text of "Bai xin" is largely written in rhymed prose,
the most common pattern being couplets consisting of
two four-character phrases.
Other patterns occur, however,
and there are a number of unrhymed passages
that may either stand alone or be connected to passages that rhyme.
In the introductory comments to the "Nei ye,"
I dealt in some detail with the end-rhymes
appearing in the four "Xin shu" chapters
and the fact that the pattern of irregular rhymes appearing in "Bai xin"
most closely fits that of various Chu 楚 texts,
such as the _Laozi_ and _Zhuangzi_.
This Chu connection is further strengthened by the fact that
the "Shi" 勢 chapter (XV, 42),
which is most certainly of Chu origin,
contains a passage (2b4; 2:86.8-9)
repeating the text of 9b9-10 (70.2) of "Bai xin."
Furthermore, the _Jing fa_ and the _Cheng_ texts
prefixed to the _Laozi_ "B" manuscript unearthed at Mawangdui
contain other passages
that are very close in language and content.[^bai-xin-1]

[^bai-xin-1]: See nn. 16 and 71, below.

In terms of content, there are many similarities between this chapter
and the "Nei ye,"
especially in regard to their stress on the prolongation of life.
Moreover, two passages found in the "Bai xin,"
10a3 (70.5) and 10a10 (70.9),
are either identical or very similar to passages
found in the "Nei ye" (3b11; 101.14 and 5a2; 102.1-2).
On the other hand, this chapter is clearly later than the "Nei ye."
Its style is much more sophisticated,
and its content clearly shows considerable development
over the basic quietist approach of the "Nei ye."
As mentioned above, the system of yoga is much more complex,
and the content in general is much more political in its orientation,
stressing law and good order
and the rectification of names.[^bai-xin-2]

[^bai-xin-2]: Kanaya Osamu, _Kanshi no kenkyū_, 264-265 and 335,
would date "Bai xin" from about the middle of the third century B.C.

In my introductory comments to the "Nei ye,"
I discussed Guo Moruo's thesis,
presented in his 1944 "Song Xing Yin Wen yizhu kao,"
that this chapter was the work of a Jixia 稷下 scholar, Yin Wen,
who was a younger contemporary of Mencius (371-289 B.C.).
Also discussed there was the view of Li Cunshan
that all four of the "Xin shu" chapters
were the work of a group that broke away from the *xiaoyao* 逍遥
or "Free and Easy Wandering" contemplative school of Zhuangzi
to develop a Daoist political faction
interested in rectifying the age.[^bai-xin-3]
Neither of these views did I find at all acceptable,
but in the case of this chapter
there is no doubt of the close connection between it
and parts of the _Zhuangzi_.
One passage, 10a10-10b3 (70.9-11),
appears to quote the _Zhuangzi_,
VII, 20/11b9-10 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, p. 214),
or at least a common source,
and there are other very close similarities.

[^bai-xin-3]: Li Cunshan, "'Nei ye' deng si pian de xiezuo shijian he zuozhe."

A third view, espoused by Qiu Xigui and Wu Guang,
was discussed in my introductory comments to "Xin shu shang."
Qiu and Wu maintain that both this chapter and the "Xin shu shang"
were the products of scholars belonging to
the school of Shen Dao 慎到 and Tian Pian 田駢,
who were also younger contemporaries of Mencius
and associated with the Jixia Academy in Qi 齊.[^bai-xin-4]
I also felt compelled to reject this solution
to the authorship of the "Xin shu shang"
but it seems to me that,
on the basis of what little we know about
the ideas proposed by these two men,
it is possible that "Bai xin" was written by
someone connected with their school.

[^bai-xin-4]: Qiu Xigui,
"Mawangdui _Laozi_ 'Jia' 'Yi' ben juanqianhou yishu yu Daofajia," 80-83,
and Wu Guang, "_Guanzi_ sipian yu Song-Yin xuepai bianxi," 38.

Such a person, however, must have come originally
from the area dominated by Chu language and culture
and been active during the first quarter of the third century B.C.
before Yin-Yang Five Phases thought came to dominate
Chinese philosophical thinking.
The text makes no mention of these concepts.
It also makes no mention of terms such as
*xu* 虚, "vacuity,"
*yin* 因, "relying on things as they are,"
or *ying* 應, "responding to things as they are,"
which became popular with later Daoists.[^bai-xin-5]

[^bai-xin-5]: For the significance of Yin-Yang cosmology
and these other terms in dating texts,
see my introductory comments to the "Nei ye" and "Xin shu shang."

Thus I would suggest that this "Bai xin" chapter
is the product of one of the Huang-Lao thinkers
associated with the Jixia Academy,
who came from the Chu cultural area
and lived during the first quarter of the third century B.C.
He may have been influenced by Shen Dao and Tian Pian,
but he was also strongly influenced by the "Nei ye" quietist tradition,
with its stress on controlling the mind,
eliminating desires, and prolonging life
through various yoga-type techniques.
No doubt he was also influenced by other Daoist works
such as the _Laozi_ and _Zhuangzi_.
Since the writer was originally from Chu,
it is highly likely that a copy of the text
eventually found its way into the Chu archives
and the library of Liu An 劉安, King of Huainan 淮南 under the Han 漢.
It was probably here that it became known
to the writers of the _Jing fa_
and other documents prefixed to the _Laozi_ manuscript.
It was also from here that it eventually,
along with the "Xin shu shang" and "Xin shu xia,"
found its way into the imperial library in Chang'an 長安,
where it came to the attention of Liu Xiang 劉向 about 26 B.C.
