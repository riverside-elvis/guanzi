# Appendix: General Introduction

## Introductory Comments

The "Nei ye" is one of the four so-called
"Xin shu" 心術 or "Art of the Mind" chapters,
the others being
"Xin shu shang" 心術上 (XIII, 36),
"Xin shu xia" 心術下 (XIII, 37),
and "Bai xin" 白心 (XIII, 38).
These four chapters all deal with aspects of Daoist quietism and,
except for the _Laozi_ and _Zhuangzi_,
represent our most important source for the study of early quietist thought.
For this reason modern Chinese and Japanese scholars
generally treat them as a unit.[^nei-ye-1]

[^nei-ye-1]: Two other chapters often grouped along with these four are
"Zhou he" 宙合 (IV.11),
and "Shu yan" 樞言 (IV, 12).

While I do not agree that all four of these chapters are as closely related
as many of these scholars maintain,
it is true that the chapters share enough in common
to warrant their discussion in some systematic fashion.
Unfortunately, their order of appearance in the _Guanzi_ makes this difficult.
For example, "Xin shu xia" (XIII, 37),
which appears to be an explication and development
of portions of the "Nei ye" (XIV, 49),
has been placed way ahead of that text in the sequence of chapters.[^nei-ye-2]
Therefore, to avoid considerable repetition and other complications,
I have rearranged the sequence of these chapters in the following manner:

[^nei-ye-2]: The "Nei ye" also appears in an entirely different section of the text,
being the fifth chapter of the "Qu yan" 區言 or "Minor Statements,"
while the "Xin shu shang," "Xin shu xia," and "Bai xin" chapters
are numbers 10, 11, and 12 of the "Duan yu" 短語 or "Short Discourses."

1. "Nei ye" (XVI, 49),
which is the longest of the four chapters,
includes some of China's earliest discussions
on the workings of the mind and the practice of breath and dietary controls.
It is also a work that after having been generally ignored
in the study of Chinese philosophy,
has recently begun to receive considerable attention from Western as
well as Chinese and Japanese scholars.[^nei-ye-3]

[^nei-ye-3]: Among Western scholars,
perhaps most noteworthy has been the work of
Gustav Haloun, Joseph Needham, Jeffrey Riegel, A. C. Graham, and Harold Roth
noted below.
Among recent Chinese works,
aside from the _Guanzi jijiao_ edited by Guo Moruo,
the most important is the commentary of Ma Feibai,
_Guanzi_ 'Nei ye' pian jizhu,'
which was published postumously in the _Guanzi xuekan_, 1990, nos. 1-3.

2. "Xin shu xia" (XIII, 37)
is closely related to the "Nei ye."
Much of it either paraphrases or develops material
contained in the "Nei ye" (stanzas VI to X)
and sometimes appears to quote directly from that text,
even to the point of prefacing these quotations with the phrase
*gu yue* 故曰,"therefore it is said."

3. "Xin shu shang" (XIII, 36)
is a completely separate work
with only general ideological connections to the "Nei ye" and "Xin shu xia."
It is divided into two distinct parts:
a series of short statements,
primarily devoted to describing the sage ruler and his political approach,
followed by a series of explanations.
The chapter deals primarily with the need to empty the mind
of distracting desires and preconceptions.

4. "Bai xin" (XIII, 38),
which expands on the treatment of some key concepts
presented in the "Nei ye" and "Xin shu shang" chapters,
is a Huang-Lao 黃老 text
primarily concerned with the demeanor of the sage,
the preservation of life,
and survival in the world of politics.

## General Ideological Background

Daoism, the underlying ideology of these four chapters,
is most often associated with ideas expressed in two major texts,
the _Zhuangzi_ and _Laozi_.
Unfortunately, the origin of neither of them is very clear.
Our present _Zhuangzi_ most certainly is a work
derived from a number of different sources,
covering a span of perhaps 150 years.
Most modern scholars now believe
that only the first seven or "Inner Chapters" of the work
represent the thought of Zhuangzi and his immediate disciples.[^nei-ye-4]
Zhuangzi, or Zhuang Zhou 莊周,
is said to have been born in Meng 蒙,
located just north of Shangqiu Shi 商丘市 in eastern Henan.
Meng was a district of the state of Song 宋,
but very near the border with Chu 楚
and strongly influenced by Chu culture.
We know almost nothing about Zhuangzi's life
except that he seems to have spent time in Chu
and in the Qi 齊 capital of Linzi 臨淄,
where he must have associated with
some of the early Jixia 稷下 scholars.[^nei-ye-5]
He probably died about 286 B.C.
Material seems to have been added to an original _Zhuangzi_ core
down to at least the early years of the Han 漢 dynasty.
Roth (p. 123) suggests that the basic text as we now know it
was put together at the court of Liu An 劉安,
King of Huainan 淮南,
about 130 B.C.
Our present version of this basic Han text, however,
dates only from about A.D. 300
when it was re-edited by Guo Xiang 郭象.

[^nei-ye-4]: For the composition of our present _Zhuangzi_,
see A. C. Graham, _Chuang-tzu_, 27-29,
and "How Much of _Chuang Tzu_ Did Chuang Tzu Write";
two articles by Liu Xiaogan,
"_Zhuangzi_ 'Neipian' zao yu 'Wai-Zapian', zhi xinzheng"
and "_Zhuangzi_ chengshu niandai kao";
and Harold Roth, "Who Compiled the _Chuang Tzu_?"
A bibliography is provided in
Michael Loewe, _Early Chinese Texts_, 56-66.

[^nei-ye-5]: For a discussion of the Jixia Academy,
see the introduction to my 1985 _Guanzi_, 15-19.
The date I gave for the founding of the academy in Qi was about 302 B.C.
However, as John Knoblock in his _Xunzi_ 1:54-55 has shown,
the beginnings of the academy go back some fifty years or so
before King Xuan's 宣 actual establishment in 302 B.C.
of a Scholars' Hall outside the Ji 稷 Gate of his capital at Linzi.

We know even less about the _Laozi_.
Tradition says that Laozi,
a name that can simply mean "Old Master,"
was an older contemporary of Confucius (551-179 B.C.)
known as Lao Dan 老聃.
The _Shi ji_ 63/1a12-1b8,
identifies him as a native of Chu,
named Li Er 李耳,
and says that he was a historian in charge of the Zhou archives.
Such an identification is now considered highly implausible.
In any case, it is clear that the _Laozi_
also is not the product of a single individual or a single time.
Its origins were probably earlier than the _Zhuangzi_,
and it was completed more or less in its present form,
except for the arrangement of the text,
by about the third quarter of the third century B.C.
when it is cited, though not by name,
and commented upon in the _Hanfeizi_.[^nei-ye-6]
Furthermore, the oldest surviving text of the Laozi,
the _Laozi_ "A" silk scroll,
discovered in 1973 in the Mawangdui 馬王堆 Han tomb III in Changsha 長沙, Hunan,
is written in the small seal script that became standard
during the Qin 秦 (221-207 B.C.)
but was replaced by a more practical clerical script
during the early Han.[^nei-ye-7]

[^nei-ye-6]: The _Hanfeizi_ (VI, 20 and VII, 21)
deals with some twenty-three chapters,
mostly from the "De" 德 section,
which comprises chapters 38-81 of our present text.
Hanfeizi himself died in 233 B.C.
For a lengthy bibliography of works dealing with the composite nature of the Laozi
and the relatively late date of parts of it,
see Herrlee G. Creel, _What Is Taoism?_, 5,
and Loewe, _Early Chinese Texts_, 269-292.

[^nei-ye-7]: For a discussion of this and the Mawangdui Laozi text
and their importance to the study of the _Guanzi_, see my 1985 _Guanzi_, 20-23.

Neither the _Laozi_ nor the _Zhuangzi_, however,
represents the beginnings of Daoism,
which seems to have derived its original impetus
from two very distinct groups of people.
The first group comprised hermits and nature-oriented philosophers
who reacted to the increasing insecurity and oppression
following the decline in Zhou imperial power
by seeking escape from society and a return to nature.
The first of these men that we know to have developed a philosophical statement
was Yang Zhu 楊朱,
who was probably a younger contemporary of Mozi (c. 479-c. 381 B.C.).
Yang stressed living to the full (*quan sheng* 全生),
the preservation of life and avoiding injury,
by escaping from the world.
According to the _Mengzi_, IIIB, 9/9,
his doctrine was each for oneself and nothing for the prince (為我是無君也).
However, mere escape is often futile,
and the avoidance of oppressive rule impossible.
Therefore the _Laozi_ carried Yang Zhu's philosophy a step further.
It maintains that by adapting to the Way and the laws governing how things change,
one can turn everything to one's advantage.
Thus a cardinal teaching of the _Laozi_ states:
"Reverse is the action of the Way;
weakness is the means it employs,"[^nei-ye-8]
and stress is placed on *wu wei* 無為, "nonassertiveness,"
or doing only what is natural and necessary.
Even so, this provides no guarantee of success,
so that Zhuangzi, taking another step,
proposed rising above it all
by considering life and death as one
and identifying the self with others.[^nei-ye-9]

[^nei-ye-8]: _Laozi_, B, 40/4a6-7 (Arthur Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, 192).

[^nei-ye-9]: See Fung Yu-lan, _A Short History of Chinese Philosophy_, 65-66.

The second group was made up of shamans and magicians,
centered mainly in the states of Chu, Qi, and Yan 燕,
who sought to prolong life by various techniques,
including diet, sexual restraint, breath control, and physical exercise,
similar to those associated with Indian yoga.[^nei-ye-10]
We do not know how far these techniques go back in Chinese history,
but one of the earliest pieces of concrete evidence
is an inscription on a twelve-sided jade knob
that probably dates from the end of the fifth
or the beginning of the fourth century B.C.[^nei-ye-11]
The inscription, which provides instructions on how to breathe,
is written in seal script, three characters to a side,
with nine characters followed by repeat marks,
thus making a total of forty-five:[^nei-ye-12]

[^nei-ye-10]: While it appears that these techniques
may well be related to Indian Yoga as part of a widespread Indo-Tai cultural tradition
extending from India across Southeast Asia to southern China,
it is important to note that there are some differences.
For an extensive discussion of early Daoist techniques and the Indian Yoga connection,
see Victor H. Mair,
"[*The*] **File** *on the Cosmic*] **Track** [*and Individual*] **Dought**[*iness*]:
Introduction and Notes for a Translation of the Ma-wang-tui Manuscripts
of the _Lao Tzu_ [Old Master],"
and Joseph Needham et al., _Science and Civilisation in China_ 2:139-152 and 5, pt. 5.

[^nei-ye-11]: Guo Moruo, "Gudai wenzi bianzheng de fazhan," 9,
dates it from the beginning of the Warring States period (453-221 B.C.)
perhaps 380 B.C., on the basis of the script's style.
Needham, _Science and Civilisation_ 2:143,
and others (see Hellmut Wilhelm, "Eine Chou-Inschrift über Atemtechnik," 386)
believe it may be as early as the sixth century B.C.

[^nei-ye-12]: Wilhelm, "Eine Chou-Inschrift," plate XIX,
shows a rubbing of the original inscription.
The following translation is based on Guo Moruo's rendition into modern Chinese
("Gudai wenzi," 9).

> To activate the breath (*xing qi* 行氣),
breathe deeply so there is great volume.
When the volume is great, the breath will expand.
When it expands, it will move downward.
When it has reached the lower level, fix it in place.
When it is in place, hold it steady.
Once it is steady, it will become like a sprouting plant.
Once it sprouts, it will grow.
As it grows it will retrace its path.
When retracing its path, it will reach the Heaven area.
The Heaven impulse forces its way upward;
the Earth impulse forces its way downward.[^nei-ye-13]
Whoever acts accordingly will live;
whoever acts contrariwise will die.

[^nei-ye-13]: "Heaven" and "Earth" seem to refer to polar points
probably located in the brain area or top of the skull
in the case of Heaven and the heels in the case of Earth.
For other translations, which also follow Guo's rendition,
see Wilhelm, "Eine Chou-Inschrift," 387,
and Needham, _Science and Civilisation_ 2:143-144 or 5, pt. 5:142,
and Mair, "[*The*] **File** *on the Cosmic*] **Track**, 35.

The _Zhuangzi_, VI, 15/1a10-12 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, p. 167),
describes a more elaborate development of this type of yoga practice:

> Puffing and blowing,
exhaling and inhaling,
expelling the old and drawing in the new,
executing bear strides and bird stretches,
longevity their only concern---such is the life favored
by the scholars who practice induction of the Way (*Dao yin* 道引),
men who nourish their health,
and those who seek to live as long as Pengzu.[^nei-ye-14]

[^nei-ye-14]: Pengzu 彭祖 is the Chinese Methuselah,
said to have lived more than a thousand years.
Bear strides (*xiong jing* 熊經)
and bird stretches (*niao shen* 鳥申)
were exercises used in connection with yoga-type practices.
One of the silk manuscripts discovered in Han tomb III at Mawangdui
originally depicted forty such exercises.
Only twenty-eight of these illustrations have survived intact,
but among them is one clearly labeled "*xiong jing*,
which depicts a man mimicking
the hulking movements of a bear standing on its hind legs.
For a revealing discussion of this text,
see Mair, "[*The*] **File** *on the Cosmic*] **Track**," 35-36.
It is to be noted that the author of this _Zhuangzi_ chapter
considers such longevity-oriented practices beneath the true sage,
who has no need for such lowly physical techniques.
The sage attains such a state of loftiness
that in his readiness to lose everything he comes to possess everything,
including longevity.

Even more advanced forms of yoga are mentioned in
_Zhuangzi_, III, 6/14b2-3 and 7/17a9-19a122 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, pp. 94-97 and 167),
which present stories about Liezi 列子 and his master, Huzi 壺子,
and Yan Hui 顏回.

By the middle of the fourth century B.C.,
the concepts and practices of these two groups had come together,
giving rise to the general point of view and body of thought,
including the _Laozi_ and _Zhuangzi_,
now known as philosophical Daoism.
These philosophical Daoists,
many of whom were connected with the Jixia Academy in Qi,
remained true to their individualistic background
and by no means represented an organized school.
In fact, their ideas were often quite contradictory.[^nei-ye-15]
Their difference in ideology stemmed not only from
different concepts of the Way,
the meaning of life,
and the composition of the universe,
but also from differing motivations on the part of the philosophers themselves.
H. G. Creel has classified these motivations as
"contemplative" and "purposive" and points out
that while the _Zhuangzi_ is in the main politically indifferent or even anarchistic,
the _Laozi_ gives a great deal of advice on
how to acquire and retain political power.[^nei-ye-16]

[^nei-ye-15]: Fung Yu-lan, in his _History_, 2:172ff,
points out that the very term "Daoist school"
did not exist prior to the Han dynasty.
He lists a number of differences in thought between the _Laozi_ and _Zhuangzi_.

[^nei-ye-16]: _What Is Taoism?_, 4-5.
Creel points to chapters 22, 25, 29, 30, 39, 57, 60, 65, and 80
as examples of these purposive sections of the _Laozi_.

Purposive Daoism divides into at least three vaguely constituted groups
made up of those who were primarily interested in prolonging life
through various self-cultivation techniques mentioned above,
those who were concerned primarily with
the application of Daoist approaches to politics,
and those who were interested in using Daoist concepts,
such as winning through yielding,
to secure military superiority.
However, the line between them was never very sharp
and usually showed itself merely in terms of emphasis.
The Daoist chapters of the _Guanzi_ represent all three of these trends.

In the *Shi ji*, 74/4a2-6,
Sima Qian refers to a group of scholars associated with the Jixia Academy,
including Shen Dao 慎到,
Tian Pian 田駢,
Jie Yu 接輿,
and Huan Yuan 環淵,
as people who studied the methods of Huang-Lao
(Huang Di 黃帝 and Laozi 老子）Daoism.
He also (63/4b 11-5a4) says that two important Legalists,
Shen Buhai 申不害 (d. 337 B.C.)
and Hanfeizi 韓非子 (d. 233 B.C.),
also based their doctrines on "Huang and Lao."
More recently, especially since the discovery of the _Laozi_ "A" and "B"
and their appended texts at Mawangdui in 1973,
the term Huang-Lao has come to be used
for a form of Daoism that combines tenets of Daoist thought
with various aspects of Confucianism and Legalism.[^nei-ye-17]
In this sense, it has come to be used extensively in reference to
the Daoist thought of the _Guanzi_.

[^nei-ye-17]: In a 1944 article,
"Song Xing Yin Wen yizhu kao," 259,
Guo Morno described Huang-Lao thought
as consisting of an amalgam of Daoism, Confucianism, and Mohism,
but this view is no longer generally accepted.

It should be pointed out, however,
that using the term Huang-Lao in connection with pre-Han texts
is somewhat a misnomer since the term does not appear in any known pre-Han text.
It is most properly used to refer to
(1) a Daoist-oriented school of political philosophy
that played an important role in the early Han
before the emperor Wu made Confucianism the state orthodoxy,
and (2) a highly mystical Daoist religious movement
that developed some time later.
For this reason several Chinese scholars have offered alternative suggestions,
but these too are not entirely satisfactory,
and therefore I have opted to follow what has now become
a more or less standard convention.[^nei-ye-18]

[^nei-ye-18]: Qiu Xigui,
"Mawangdui _Laozi_ 'Jia' 'Yi' ben juanqianhou yishu yu Daofajia," 76,
and Kanaya Osamu, _Kanshi no kenkyū_: *Chugoku kodai shisōshi no ichimen*,
use the term "*Daofa*" 道法, "Daoist Legalism."
Wu Guang, "_Guanzi_ sipian yu Song-Yin xue-pai bianxi," 41,
prefers "Xin Lao xue" 新老學, "Neo-Laoziism."
One of their chief arguments against using the term Huang-Lao
to describe the thought of texts dating from before
the middle of the third century B.C. is that they lack any mention of Yin-Yang,
an extremely important concept in Han dynasty Huang-Lao thought.

What is this so-called *Huang-Lao xue* 黃老學,
especially as it appears in the _Guanzi_?
One of its most important characteristics is that its Daoist component
differs from the Daoism that predominates in the _Laozi_ and _Zhuangzi_
in several important areas:
The Way becomes much more naturalistic and less mystical.
It remains a first principle,
but it is no longer entirely nameless.
It tends to be treated as a natural law of the universe,
but at the same time it tends to lose its position
as something beyond Heaven and Earth.
In fact, at times it appears as merely a creative force
existing between Heaven and Earth.
Emphasis is placed on the relationship between
names (*ming* 名)
and forms (*xing* 形)
or realities (*shi* 實),
timeliness instead of timelessness,
law (*fa* 法), which is rooted in the Way,
and political methods (*shu* 術) as a means to establish good order.
The ideal ruler becomes a Daoist sage,
ruling through nonassertiveness (*wu wei*)
and practicing various quietist techniques,
while the work of administration is performed by his ministers and bureaucracy.
Confucian virtues, especially
*ren* 仁, "human goodness" or "benevolence,"
*yi* 義, "a sense of duty" or "righteous conduct,"
and *li* 禮, "ritualistic principles" or "propriety,"
are valued.[^nei-ye-19]

[^nei-ye-19]: Compare this with the attitude of the contemplative Daoism
as expressed in the _Laozi_, B, 38/1a (Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, 189),
and repeated again in the _Zhuangzi_, VII, 22/22b (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 235):
"Therefore when the Way was lost, the Power appeared.
When the Power was lost, humaneness appeared.
When humaneness was lost, a sense of duty appeared.
When a sense of duty was lost, propriety appeared.
Now propriety is a superficial expression of loyalty and trustworthiness
and the beginning of disorder."

## Meaning of Xin shu

The use of the term *xin shu* in connection with these chapters presents a problem.
It is a fairly common term in pre-Han and Han literature.[^nei-ye-20]
However, it appears only once in the text of these four chapters,
and that is under somewhat dubious circumstances
in the explanatory section of "Xin shu shang", (3a1-2; 63.12-13).
In fact, I believe this reference to *xin shu*
may well involve deliberate tampering with the text by some early commentator
who was attempting to explain the meaning of the title.[^nei-ye-21]
The title itself is appropriate for the primary subject of these chapters,
but there is some question about how it should be translated.

[^nei-ye-20]: See, for example,
the _Zhuangzi_, V, 13/14b1 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 145-146),
the _Xunxi_, XV, 21/1b8-9 and 13b9-10 (Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 3:100 and 103),
and XVIII, 25/2b7 (Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 3:176),
the _Li ji_, XI, 19/15a9 (Legge, _Li Ki_ 28:110),
the _Huainanzi_, 1/14b7 and 7/11b1O (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, 24 and 75),
the _Shuo yuan_, 19/13b3 and 14a10.
The "Treatise on Literature" of the _Qian-Han shu_, 30/23b4-5,
also lists a separate work entitled _Xin shu_.

[^nei-ye-21]: See the "Xin shu shang," 3a1-2 (63.12- 13) and n. 36.

The character for *xin*, 心, is a pictograph of the physical heart,
and this is its basic meaning.
However, by extension it is also used to refer to the mind or,
just as in the West, the emotions.[^nei-ye-22]
Why the early Chinese should have associated the mind with the heart
rather than the brain (*nao* 腦, lit., the substance inside the top of the skull)
is not at all clear.
It probably has something to do with the fact that
the beating of the heart, along with the breath,
is the most obvious distinction between life and death.
*Shu* originally seems to have meant a "road" or "path,"
and by extension "the way things operate," "method" or "technique,"
and finally a "skill" or "art."

[^nei-ye-22]: In my 1965 _Kuan-tzu_,
I rather consistently translated *xin* as "heart" or "heart/mind"
rather than simply as "mind."
Here I have used both "mind" and "heart," depending upon the context.
Actually there are problems connected with all three of these translations.
For a fascinating discussion of the subject,
see Harold H. Oshima,
"A Metaphorical Analysis of the Concept of Mind in the _Chuang-tzu_."

The term *xin shu* appears in one other chapter of the _Guanzi_,
"Qi fa" 七法 or "Seven Standards" (II, 16/1b7-8; 1:22.12),
where it is listed as one of the standards along with laws of nature (*ze* 則),
physical qualities (*xiang* 象),
standards for measurement *fa* 法),
forms of transformation (*hua* 化),
permissive or inhibitory actions (*jue shu* 決塞),
and categories of mensuration (*ji shu* 計數)
that are vital for successful rule.
Further on (2a5-6; 23.3),
the text explains that
"Being factual, sincere, liberal, generous, temperate, or altruistic
is called *xin shu*," which I translated there as "patterns of mental behavior."

In the _Zhuangzi_, V, 13/14b1 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, pp. 145-146),
*Li ji*, XI, 19/1b8-9 (Legge, *Li Ki* 28:110),
and _Huainanzi_, 7/11b10 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, p. 75),
all references cited in note 20 above,
it seems to refer to the operation of the mind.
However, in the _Guiguzi_, 3/5b1-6,
and _Shuo yuan_, 19/13b3 and 14a10,
it clearly refers to the art of nurturing the mind.
The _Huainanzi_, 1/14b7 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, p. 24),
even appears to cite our "Xin shu shang" chapter indirectly
in a story about Xu You 許由, a hermit who refused the imperial throne
when it was offered to him by Emperor Yao 堯:

> The most important thing in the world lies not with Yao,
but with me, not with others, but with my own self.
When the self grasps the Way, all things are complete.
When one goes deeply into the principles of the art of the mind,
then one finds lust and desire, likes and dislikes to be extraneous.

The _Xunzi_, I, 2/9a10-11 (Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 1:154),
contains a relevant passage:

> It is ever so that in respect to
the art of controlling the breath and nurturing the mind,
nothing is more direct than observing the rules of propriety,
more important than having a good teacher,
or more spiritually enlightening than concentrating on what one likes.
This is called 治氣養心之術,
"the art of controlling the breath and nurturing the mind."

Thus I have used "art of the mind" as my translation for *xin shu*
in the title of these chapters.

What is this "art"
According to the somewhat dubious passage in the "Xin shu shang" mentioned above,
"The art of the mind lies in controlling the apertures
(eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, and sex organ)
through nonassertiveness."
The mind must remain empty of all preconceptions and desires
so that the nine apertures can do their work.
If the mind is clouded by preconceptions or desires,
the eyes, ears, and other apertures will not be able to perform their proper functions. By keeping the mind empty one can grasp the Way,
respond to objective circumstances,
prolong one's life, and insure one's sagelike rule.
This is the general message conveyed by all four of these chapters.
It represents a tradition that found a very strong following
among the Jixia scholars and had great influence on later philosophers,
including such notables as Xunzi.
In fact the _Xunzi_, XIV, 21/4b9-5b7 (Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 3:104),
provides an excellent summary of this tradition:

> How do men come to know the Way?
I say that it is through the mind.
How does the mind know?
I say it is through vacuity (*xu* 虚),
concentration (*yi* 一 or 壹),
and quiescence (*jing* 靜).
The mind never stops storing up things;
nonetheless, it has what is called the capacity for vacuity.
The mind is forever filled with conflicting ideas;
nonetheless, it has what is called the capacity for concentration.
The mind never stops moving;
nonetheless, it has what is called the capacity for quiescence.

> Men from birth have the capacity to know,
and having the capacity to know, there is memory.
Memory is what is stored;
nonetheless, the mind still has what is called the capacity for vacuity.
Not permitting what the self has stored to interfere
with what is about to be received is called "vacuity."
The mind from birth has the capacity to know,
and having this capacity, there is the perception of differences.
Perception of differences means to know different things at the same time.
To know different things at the same time is to have conflicting ideas.
Nonetheless, there is still what is called concentration.
Not permitting one thing to interfere with another is called "concentration."
When the mind is asleep, it dreams.
When it is relaxed, it moves of its own accord.
When it is employed, it schemes.
Therefore, the mind is never without movement.
Nonetheless, there is still the capacity for quiescence.
Not permitting dreams and petty annoyances to disrupt this capacity to know
is called "quiescence."

## Rhymes

All four of these "Xin shu" chapters make extensive use of rhyme,
and while the appearance of rhymed passages in the _Gaunzi_ is not unusual,
I have paid special attention to it here
because of the relatively high incidence of irregular rhymes,
especially in the "Nei ye" and "Bai xin,"
which tells us something about the relationship of these chapters
as well as providing a clue to their origins.

As mentioned in the introduction to this volume,
scholars have long recognized that among a certain group
of fourth- and third-century B.C. texts whose reputed authors
were supposed to have come from the general area of the state of Chu,
including the _Chu ci_, _Laozi_, and _Zhuangzi_
certain irregular rhyme patterns appear with enough consistency
for them to be considered representative of a regional dialect.
This is further confirmed by the fact that these irregular rhyme patterns
also appear in Han texts associated with the same area,
such as the _Huainanzi_.
Moreover, the four texts prefixed to the _Laozi_ "B" manuscript
unearthed at Mawangdui, which appear to have been of Chu origin,
also adhere to this pattern.[^nei-ye-23]
The most important of these particularly distinguishing irregular rhymes
include rhyme groups:
之 (*əy* or *ək*) with 幽 (*əw* or *əwk*),[^nei-ye-24]
之 with 魚 (*ay* or *ak*),
侯 (*ew* or *ewk*) with 魚,
真 (*en*) with 耕 (*eng*),
and 陽 (*ang*) with 東 (*ewng*).[^nei-ye-25]
Also, 之 appears frequently as an end-rhyme,
and the restrictions on fourth-tone rhymes are much looser.

[^nei-ye-23]: See Long Hui, "Mawangdui chutu _Laozi_ ben juanqian guyi shu tanyuan."

[^nei-ye-24]: This 之 - 魚 combination does not appear in the _Laozi_.

[^nei-ye-25]: The phonetic reconstructions for archaic Chinese in this volume
are taken from Chou Fa-kao's _Hanzi gujin yihui_.

Although these are the most common end-rhymes associated with Chu texts,
an examination of the irregular rhyme tables on pp. 144-150
of Lung Yu Shun's "Xian-Qin sanwen zhong de yunwen (shang)"
shows that the _Laozi_ and _Zhuangzi_
and several other texts associated with the Chu area,
including the _Wenzi_,
_Huang Di neijing suweni_,
and _Huang Di neijing lingshu_,
also share a number of other irregular patterns,
and while none of these patterns can be said to be strictly limited to Chu texts,
the frequency of their appearance in such texts is much higher
than in those known to come from other parts of China.

A list of the irregular rhymes appearing in these four "Xin shu" chapters
is presented in chart 1.
From it we can see that most of the irregular rhymes
appear in the two chapters,
"Nei ye" and "Bai xin."
The two examples listed for the "Xin shu xia" merely involve tone.
Of the four examples listed for "Xin shu shang,"
three are of the 之---幽 category
and involve the character 道, "way."[^nei-ye-26]

[^nei-ye-26]: Wang Niansun (see _Guanzi jijiao_ 2:633)
would read 道 as 歭 (diəy group 之),
thus making it a regular rhyme in these cases.
However, since 道 appears in rhyme with other words in the 幽 group,
I do not believe his point is valid.


Chart 1. Irregular Rhymes in the Four "Xin Shu" Chapters

                    索 - 所

脂 2nd with 微 4th                                  指 - 習
脂 2nd with 微 4th  失 - 物
之 as an end-rhyme  5                               4

Since the "Nei ye" and "Bai xin" chapters are longer than the other two,
it is not surprising that they should contain the largest number of irregular rhymes,
but it is surprising that there should be so little overlap.
Only the combinations of groups 之 - 魚 and 脂 - 微 appear
in both the "Nei ye" and "Bai xin,"
while the very common combination of 之 - 幽
appears in both the "Xin shu shang" and "Bai xin,"
but not in the "Nei ye." 
This relative lack of overlap would tend to support the conclusion
that these chapters all came from different sources and probably different times.
Although the sample is small,
it would also appear that in terms of irregular rhyme usage,
as indicated in Lung Yu Shun's tables, "Bai xin"
is closest to the _Zhuangzi_, _Huang Di neijing suwen_,
and _Huang Di neijing lingshu_, closely followed by the _Wenzi_ and _Laozi_,
The "Nei ye" contains none of the common irregular rhymes
associated with the _Laozi_,
之 - 幽,
侯 - 魚,
真 - 耕 ,
and 東 - 陽,
which are usually considered to be among the primary indicators of Chu dialect.
However, again in terms of its overall use of irregular rhymes,
it appears to be closest to the _Wenzi_ and _Zhuangzi_
followed by the _Laozi_, _Huang Di neijing suwen_,
_Huang Di neijing lingshu_, and _Yi Zhou shu_.
Since, with the possible exception of the _Yi Zhou shu_,
all of these texts are thought to be of southern or Chu origin,
it is very possible that both the "Bai xin" and "Nei ye" chapters
are also from this area.[^nei-ye-27]
This possibility is strengthened by the marked similarity of passages
appearing in the "Nei ye" and "Bai xin",
and the _Jing fa_, _Shi da jing_ (_Shiliu jing_) and _Cheng_ texts
prefixed to the Mawangdui _Laozi_ "B" manuscript.[^nei-ye-28]
It is also perhaps worth noting that "Xin shu shang"
and "xia" and "Bia xin" appear in a cluster of other chapters
in this "Duan yu" section, notably,
"Shui di" 水地 (XIV, 39),
"Shi" 勢 (XV, 42),
and "Zheng" 正 (XV, 43)
which are also of probable Chu origin.
The same may be true for
"Si shi" 四時 (XIV, 40)
and "Wu xing" 五行 (XIV, 41).

[^nei-ye-27]: The existing _Wenzi, Huang Di neijing suwen_,
_Huang Di neijing lingshu_,
and _Yi Zhou shu_
have all been the subject of controversy.
Some scholars have labeled the _Wenzi_ a post-Han forgery based on the _Huainanzi_,
while others say it is Han or pre-Han.
Long Hui, "Mawangdui chutu _Laozi_ 'Yi' ben juanqian guyi shu tanyuan," 27,
considers it to be a legitimate Chu text.
The prevailing view concerning the _Huang Di neijing suwen_
is that it is Han with some parts even earlier.
The _Huang Di neijing lingshu_ is probably post-Han,
but based on earlier materials.
The _Yi Zhou shu_ was probably put together during the Han from earlier materials,
including those from the states of Jin 晉 and Chu.
See Zhang Xincheng, _Weishu tongkao_, 811-818, 969-984, and 600-616.

[^nei-ye-28]: One of these passages in the _Shi da jing_ (_Shiliu jing_)
is of particular interest because it also appears in the _Wenzi_ and _Huainanzi_,
both of which are associated with Chu.
See n. 111 , below.

# Appendix: Introduction to the "Nei ye"

## Composition of the "Nei ye"

The "Nei ye" is a lengthy hortatory text that,
with the exception of a few short passages
in stanzas VII.1, VIII.1, IX.3, and XIII,
is almost entirely in rhyme.
Its various parts were most likely chanted orally
and existed in a number of different versions
long before our existing version was put into writing.
The text is primarily composed of pairs of balanced lines
of two four-character phrases each,
but this meter is frequently broken by passages with lines of irregular length,
usually of three or five characters.
The rhyming pattern and meter of the "Nei ye"
tend to be more complex than those of other chapters in the _Guanzi_.
The length of stanzas and their subdivisions is very uneven,
and there is a wide variety of patterns,
the most common being *aa*, *bb*.
However, it may be *aaa*, *bb*, or *aaa*, *bbb* etc.
Furthermore, while the most common pattern is for rhymes to appear
either at the end of two or more phrases of three or four characters
or at the end of two or more lines consisting of two phrases of four characters each,
other patterns also occur.

Surviving editions of the _Guanzi_ usually have two or three breaks in this text,
thus dividing it into three or four separate sections,[^nei-ye-29]
but several modern scholars have further subdivided these into stanzas
of varying length largely based on content
as well as rhyme pattern and meter.[^nei-ye-30]
In spite of some disagreement among these scholars
as to how many stanzas there should be
and where they should begin and end,
in most cases the situation is fairly clear.
The major difference in the way these scholars have divided the text
stems from their treatment of short pieces that could stand alone.
I have followed the scheme adopted by Ma Feibai,
who divides the text into fifteen stanzas,
with most of these being forther subdivided
into shorter units of varying length.[^nei-ye-31]

[^nei-ye-29]: The Zhao edition of the text
is divided into four separate parts:
Ia7-2a5 (99.8-100.5),
2a6-2bl (100.6-100.10),
2b2-4b2 (100.11-102.8),
and 4b3-6b10 (102.9-104.9).
The Yang edition has the same divisions.

[^nei-ye-30]: For example, Ma Feibai (_Guanzi_ 'Nei ye' pian jizhu")
and Shi Yishen both divide the text into fifteen stanzas,
but there is some difference in their composition,
especially since Shi Yishen shifts bits and pieces of the text
from one place to another.
Zhao Shouzheng as well as Jeffrey Riegel
("The Four 'Tzu Ssu' Chapters," 152-169)
divide the text into eighteen stanzas,
but Riegel, who appears to have based his divisions on some unpublished work
of Gustav Haloun, further divides three of his eighteen into substanzas
for a total of twenty-two.

[^nei-ye-31]: In my 1965 _Kuan-tzu_ translation,
I chose to divide the text into paragraphs in accordance with
the comments on the text contained in "Xin shu xia."
However, this tended to disrupt the meter and poetic integrity of the original.

While there is some overall developmental logic
to the sequence of these stanzas, the "Nei ye"
differs from ordinary essay-type texts,
even those written in rhyme prose,
in that each stanza can exist as an independent unit.
I suspect that originally was indeed the case,
since not only is there considerable repetition,
but the usage of terms seems to vary somewhat from stanza to stanza.
Furthermore, some passages, such as stanza VI.1,
appear to have little connection with what precedes or follows
and sound like self-contained chants.
In general, the first eight stanzas provide a philosophical base
for the remaining seven, which deal primarily with how to prolong life
and live in the world.

## The Meaning of the "Nei ye"

In previous translations I have rendered *nei ye*
as "inner life", or "inner workings,"
while A. C. Graham and Harold Roth have use "inward training,"
and Jeffrey Riegel has translated it as "workings of the inner."[^nei-ye-32]
In early Chinese texts, *ye* had a variety of meanings,
but most common were "activity," "work," "deeds," or "achievements."
Chinese Buddhists later used it as a translation for "karma,"
which in Sanskrit also meant "work."
In modern Chinese it is often used to mean "business,"
and the 畢業 means "to complete one's training" or "to be graduated."
Here, as a title, *nei ye* primarily refers to the workings of the mind,
but any of the above translations is possible.

[^nei-ye-32]: See my 1965 _Kuan-tzu_;
Victor Mair, ed.,
_The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature_, 17-27;
Graham, _Disputers of the Tao_, 100;
Roth, "Psychology and Self-Cultivation," 609,
and Riegel, "The Four 'Tzu Ssu' Chapters," 143.

## Key Terms

Much of what the "Nei ye" has to say is centered around several key terms.
The first of these is *jing* 精,
which originally meant fine and pure rice.
By extension it came to mean the unadulterated essence of things
or a state of mind that is concentrated on a single purpose.
It is also used to refer to the seed of human life.
In the "Nei ye," it primarily refers to a seminal or vital essence
that is the source of all living things,
from the star gods above to the five grains below
and the ghosts and spirits (*guishen* 鬼神）floating in the space between.

Another key term is *qi* 氣 (originally written 气),
which has a wide range of meanings,
from the common air we breathe
to a primal ether that provides the material base for the universe.
In the _Guanzi_ it usually refers to the vital forces of nature,
such as the Yin and Yang,
but in this chapter it means either the physical breath or a vital force
representing the vital essence (*jing*)
in its kinetic form.[^nei-ye-33]
As a vital force, *qi* (stanza I.3)
is never to be restrained by physical strength or force
but may be brought to rest by the *de* 得,
the mystical or spiritual Power,
which the manifestation of the *Dao* 道 or "Way" within the individual.[^nei-ye-34]

[^nei-ye-33]: In answer to a question from Gongsun Chou 公孫丑
about how he maintained an unperturbed mind,
Mencius replied (_Mengzi_, IIA, 2/9ff.):
"The will (*zhi* 志) is the leader of the *qi* and the *qi* is what fills the body.
Since the will is supreme and the *qi* secondary,
I say maintain firm the will and do no violence to the *qi*....
When the will is given primacy,
it sets the qi in motion;
when the qi is given primacy,
it sets the will in motion."
Gongsun Chou then went on to ask about the great floodlike *qi*
and Mencius replied:
"It is difficult to explain.
This the *qi*---it is exceedingly great and exceedingly strong.
Nourish it with rectitude and place no obstacle in its path
and it will fill all between Heaven and Earth.
This, the *qi*---it is on a par with righteousness and the Way in that without it,
one is in a state of starvation."

[^nei-ye-34]: For detailed discussions of *jing* and *qi*
see Gu Baotian, "Shilun _Guanzi_ jing-qi shuo de xingzhi";
Zhou Lisheng and Wang Demin, "_Guanzi_ zhong de *jing-qi* lun ji qi lishi gongxian";
and Li Cunshan, "'Nei ye' deng si pian de *jing-qi* sixiang tanwei."

The *Dao* in this text is the ultimate creative force in the universe.[^nei-ye-35]
According to stanza III,
the Way is what fills our *xing* 形
(which may mean either "physical form" or the mind's "gestalt"),
but one cannot hold it in place.
Stanza IV.1 adds that with "the mind quiescent (*jing* 靜)
and the vital force well managed,
the Way can be made to stay."
In stanza V, the Way
"is the means to cultivate the mind.
Losing it, men die; having it, they live.
Losing it, undertakings fail; having it, they succeed."[^nei-ye-36]

[^nei-ye-35]: As indicated above,
the different stanzas are not always consistent in their presentation of these terms.
Here is an example. Stanza VI.1 states:
"What to all things gives life and brings them to fruition is called the Way."
On the other hand, stanza XII states:
"It is ever so that in man's life,
Heaven produces his vital essence.
Earth produces his form."

[^nei-ye-36]: Kanaya Osamu, "Taoist Thought in the _Kuan-tzu_," 35,
describes the Dao in the "Nei ye" as an objective entity,
existing in a fluid state on a cosmic scale,
that enters and abides in a person's mind under certain conditions,
such as when the mind is at peace and the feelings are calm.

Closely associated with *Dao* is another term,
*Shen* 神 or 神明, "the Spirit,"
which appears to be a manifestation of the *Dao*
or perhaps just another appellation for the *Dao* itself.[^nei-ye-37]
According to stanza VII.1:
"What is at one with things and able to bring about their transformation
is called the Spirit."
Further along (stanza VII.2),
the text adds:
"The supremacy of the Spirit---how brilliant---it knows all things.
Preserve it within and do not go to excess.
Do not let things confuse the senses.
Do not let the senses confuse the mind.
This is called internalization of the Spirit."
Again in VII.3:
"Respectfully keep clean its abode,
and its vital essence will naturally come.
Quiet your thoughts in order to contemplate it.
Rest your mind in order to keep control of it.
Maintain a dignified appearance and respectful attitude,
then its vital essence will of itself become stable."
The _Huainanzi_, 1/16a13 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, p. 27), states:
"The bodily form (*xing* 形) is the abode of life;
the vital force is its filler (*chong* 充);
the Spirit is its regulator (*zhi* 制)."

[^nei-ye-37]: Although *Shen* was often used in early texts
to refer to the supreme deity of the Zhou Heaven,
in this chapter it seems to appear as another term for the *Dao*.
It is perhaps worth noting that the terms *Dao* and *Shen*
never appear together in the same stanza,
a fact that strengthens my suspicion that this "Nei ye" chapter is a composite,
made up of stanzas that, by and large, had an independent existence
before being set down in writing.

Another word associated with *Dao* and *Shen* is *Yi* 一,
which may mean to concentrate or focus one's attention on something,
to be of single purpose,
or to be at one with something,
but it also can be used as a noun to mean "the One,"
that eternal principle which never changes.
It appears to have this meaning in stanza VII.1:
"To transform without altering one's vital force,
to change without altering one's wisdom---only the man of quality
who grasps the One is able to do this."[^nei-ye-38]

[^nei-ye-38]: The meaning of *Zhi Yi* 執一, "grasps the One," is not entirely clear.
The _Laozi_, A, 10/5a, (Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, 153),
and the _Zhuangzi_, VIII, 23/4b7 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 253),
in a similar context write *bao Yi* 抱一, "embrace the One."
The _Laozi_ commentator Wang Bi 王弼 (226-249) explains "the One"
as meaning "man's true nature."
Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, 154,
explains it as the undivided state that underlies the normal consciousness.
I have interpreted "the One" as a reference to the Way.
According to the _Huainanzi_, 1/11a2 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, 17),
the Way "merges in the Formless,
and what we call the Formless means the One."
Stanza VII.1 also speaks of understanding the "one word"
in an apparent reference to the Way.

There are also several key terms that have to do with the functioning of the mind.
This functioning is best described in stanza VIII.1-3,
which begins with a discussion of the Way and the need to understand it:

> What do we mean by understanding it?
This lies in the mind's regulation.
When our minds are well regulated,
our sense organs are also well regulated.
When our minds are at ease,
our sense organs are also at ease.
What regulates them is the mind;
what sets them at ease is the mind.
The mind therefore contains an inner mind.
That is to say within the mind there is another mind.
In that mind's mind,
the power of awareness comes before sound.
After awareness come forms.
After forms come names.
After names comes putting the mind to use.
After putting the mind to use comes its regulation.[^nei-ye-39]

[^nei-ye-39]: For a detailed discussion of concepts of consciousness
in early Chinese thought,
see Liu Zhongxian, "_Guanzi_ si pian de yishi lun."

In this passage the term *yi* 意,
which I have translated as "power of awareness,"
is of special interest.
It seems to refer to a basic mental capacity that precedes thought.
This is brought out more clearly in the comparable passage
in the "Xin shu xia," 8a4-7 (68.7-8):
"The power of awareness comes before words.
After awareness comes forms,
and after forms comes thought.
After thought comes knowledge."
Stanza I.3 of the "Nei ye"
also contains the statement that the *qi* may never be summoned by one's call
but "may be made welcome by one's power of awareness."

Of particular importance to the proper functioning of the mind is its *xing* 形,
*Xing* basically means "form,"
and it appears with this meaning several times in the chapter,
especially in reference to the body.
However, it also appears in the expression
*xin zhi xing* 心之形, lit., "the form of the mind."
In this case I have translated as "gestalt,"
in reference to the mind's overall character.
Stanza II.1 states:
"It is ever so that the mind's gestalt is naturally full and naturally replete,
naturally born and naturally perfected.
Should its function be impaired,
it is certain to be due to
sorrow and happiness, joy and anger, desire and profit seeking."

For the mind to enjoy a proper gestalt
and to avoid artificiality or overassertiveness in action (*wu wei*),
it is necessary for it to be quiescent (*jing* 靜).
According to stanza IV.1:
"The mind quiescent and the vital force well managed,
the Way can then be made to stay."
The _Zhuangzi_, V, 13/12a (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, p. 142),
describes quiescence as a state in which nothing can disturb the mind.

In the "Nei ye," Confucian virtues are also mentioned as having a role
in maintaining an individual's equilibrium and general well-being.
According to stanza XIII:

> For arresting anger, nothing is better than poetry.
For getting rid of sorrow, nothing is better than music.
For moderating music, nothing is better than rules of propriety.
For preserving rules of propriety, nothing is better than respect.
For preserving respect, nothing is better than quiescence.[^nei-ye-40]

[^nei-ye-40]: This passage may well be a later addition.
Its Confucian message not only seems out of place in the general context,
but it also represents the longest unrhymed passage in the text.

The last part of the chapter stresses the importance of practicing
dietary and breath control and getting rid of emotion.
As stated in stanza XIV.1:
"With excessive gorging the breath will be harmed
and the form will be unable to hold it all.
With excessive abstention the bones will dry up and the blood will congeal."
XIV.2 urges:
"Expand your mind, and you will feel release.
Deepen your breathing and you will feel relaxed."
XV.1 then goes on to say:
"It is ever so that man's life is certain to depend on his being content.
Through sorrow he loses his guiding tread;
through anger he loses his beginnings.
In sorrow and melancholy, joy and anger,
the Way can find no resting place."

## Authorship and Dating

Luo Genze in his _Guanzi tanyuan_ (pp. 86-90 and 105-107)
states that the "Xin shu" chapters date from
the end of the middle part of the Warring States period,
that is, the late fourth to early third centuries B.C.
On this point most Chinese and foreign scholars are agreed.
Where they differ is in the matter of authorship
and the relative dating of these four chapters
in relation to other texts of the time,
such as the _Mengzi_ and _Zhuangzi_.

Among Chinese scholars, three basic points of view tend to dominate the discussion.
The first centers around an article written by Guo Moruo in 1944
in which he maintained that all four of the "Xin shu" chapters
are remnants of the writings of two Jixia scholars,
Song Xing 宋新 and Yin Wen 尹文.[^nei-ye-41]
According to Guo, Song Xing and Yin Wen
were both contemporaries of Mencius (371-289 B.C.),
with Song slightly older and Yin slightly younger.
They both leaned toward Daoism
but were primarily influenced by Mozi (c. 479-c. 381 B.C.)
in that they were against war and criticized luxurious living, including overeating.
They accepted Confucian virtues such as humaneness, a sense of duty, and propriety,
as well as the Confucian respect for music.
It is the amalgam of these views that Guo then dubs as "Huang-Lao."

[^nei-ye-41]: Guo Moruo, "Song Xing Yin Wen yizhu kao."
Kanaya Osamu, _Kanshi no kenkyū_, 260 and 296,
also cites a 1943 article published in _Shuowen yuekan_ 説文月刊
by Liu Jie 劉節 and entitled
"_Guanzi_ zhong suo jian zhi Song Xing yipai xueshuo"
管子中所見之宋鉼一派學説
[The Theories of the Song Xing School Appearing in the _Guanzi_].
Unfortunately, I have never seen it.

Guo asserts (p. 247) that the original statements of "Xin shu shang"
were written by Song Xing himself,
while the explanations consist of notes taken by his students during his lectures.
He also says that both the "Nei ye" and "Xin shu xia" were also written by Song,
the latter being the original version of the same text.
Later the text of the "Xin shu xia" was badly damaged in transmission,
leading to the loss of both its beginning and end
and the scrambling of slips in what remained.
The reason given for the two being separated in the _Guanzi_
is that Liu Xiang 劉向 obtained them from different collections.[^nei-ye-42]
The "Bai xin," which shows a further development of Song's ideas,
was written by Song's disciple Yin Wen,
who was influenced by other Jixia scholars,
including Daoists such as Huan Yuan, Guan Yin 關尹, and Jie Yu,
and by Shen Dao, who combined Daoism and Legalism,
and the Confucian "golden mean" philosophy expressed in the "Zhong yong."[^nei-ye-43]

[^nei-ye-42]: See my 1985 _Guanzi_, 7,
for Liu's statement concerning his editing of the _Guanzi_.

[^nei-ye-43]: The "Zhong yong" has traditionally been attributed to
Zi Si (Tzu Ssu) 子思, the grandson of Confucius,
an attribution apparently accepted by Guo.
However, Jeffrey Riegel, in his "The Four 'Tzu Ssu' Chapters,"
shows that the origin of the _Zhong yong_ had nothing to do with Zi Si
and the present work is a Han composition
based on earlier models such as the "Nei ye."

Song Xing is mentioned in a number of early texts,
including the _Mengzi_, _Zhuangzi_, _Xunzi_, and _Hanfeizi_,
where he is usually described in Mohist terms.[^nei-ye-44]
Less is known about Yin Wen.[^nei-ye-45]
However, both he and Song Xing are described in some detail
in another chapter of the _Zhuangzi_, X, 33/16a10-16b9
(Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, pp. 367-368):

[^nei-ye-44]: _Mengzi_, VIB, 4,
where he is known as Song Keng 宋牼;
_Zhuangzi_, I, 1/4b (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 31-32,
where he is known as Song Rongzi 宋榮子;
_Xunzi_, III, 6/8b1-6,
XI, 17/14b4-5,
XII, 18/11a6ff,
and XV, 21/3a12 (Knoblock, _Xunzi_ 1:223 and 3:22, 45, and 102),
and _Hanfeizi_, XIX, 50/9b3ff (Liao, _Han Fei Tzu_ 2:300),
where he is known as Song Rong.
The "Treatise on Literature," of the _Qian-Han shu_, 30/23a13,
lists a *Songzi* 宋子 in eighteen *pian*,
but this work has long since disappeared.

[^nei-ye-45]: The "Treatise on Literature"
of the _Qian-Han shu_, 30/19b7,
also lists a Yin Wenzi 尹文子 in one *pian* but this work was lost,
and the surviving work that bears its name is considered to be a late forgery.
See Zhang Xincheng, _Weishu tongkao_, 921-929.

> To maintain a pure mind (*bai xin* 白心)
by being uninhibited by current fashion
and unpretentious in respect to material things,
by being neither hypercritical (emending 苟 to 苛) of other men
nor hostile toward the masses,
by seeking peace in the world in order to preserve the lives of the people,
and by asking for no more than that required
to provide for others and one's self---such were aspects of the Way
as practiced in ancient times.
Song Xing and Yin Wen heard about these models for behavior
and were delighted with them.
They fashioned a [flat-topped] hat shaped like Mount Hua 華山 [to indicate equality]
and adopted it as their symbol.
In interacting with all things,
they began by discriminating [between true glory and shame]
and being tolerant of other people.
They discussed the phenomena of the mind,
referring to them as patterns of mental activity (*xin zhi xing* 心之行).
Adopting a warm and friendly attitude,
they sought to bring men together in joyous accord
in order to harmonize all within the four seas,
and expressed their desire to establish such concepts as prevailing principles.
They felt it no disgrace to suffer insult,
but sought to save people from fighting,
to bring a stop to aggression,
to abolish the use of arms,
and to rescue their generation from war.
They took this message throughout the world,
attempting to persuade the lofty and instruct the lowly.
Even though the world refused to accept them,
they persisted in raising their voices and would not give up.
Thus it was said that both those on high and those below grew weary of seeing them,
yet they persisted in being seen.[^nei-ye-46]

[^nei-ye-46]: For a more detailed summary of what we know about Song Xing and Yin Wen,
see Fung Yu-lan, _History_ 1:148-153.

Guo's thesis seems to have been greatly influenced
by the presence in this _Zhuangzi_ passage of a reference to *bai xin*,
the title of one of our "Xin shu" texts,
and the interest of Song and Yin in the phenomena of the mind.
However, the term *bai xin* is used here
not to describe the philosophy of Song and Yin,
but rather how the Way was practiced in ancient times.[^nei-ye-47]
Furthermore, since the term appears only in the title of the "Bai xin" chapter
and not in the text,
it is very likely that the title was provided long after the composition of the text.
It was common for early Chinese texts to have no title
but to be known simply by one to three important characters appearing in the text,
often in the opening line.
It was not until the Han that many texts were assigned formal titles.
For example, chapter I, 2 of the _Guanzi_, "Xing shi" 形勢,
was known to Sima Qian as "Shan gao" 山高,
was the first two characters of the text,
and it does not seem to have received its present title
until the time of Liu Xiang.[^nei-ye-48]
As for an interest in the phenomena of the mind,
this was shared by a wide range of writers in the early third century,
including Mencius and the contributors to the _Zhuangzi_.

[^nei-ye-47]: For a similar conclusion, see A. C. Graham,
"How Much of _Chuang Tzu_ Did Chuang Tzu Write?" 316-317.

[^nei-ye-48]: See my 1985 _Guanzi_, 6.

Be that as it may, Guo's views tended to dominate the field for a number of years,
but by the 1980s more and more people were questioning them.[^nei-ye-49]
A number of scholars have pointed out that while these chapters
share some points in common with Mohist thought in being against war
and advocating a frugal life-style,
there are major differences.
This is particularly true of the "Nei ye" with its stress on
*jing*, vital essence,
and *qi* vital force,
and its preoccupation with prolonging life through dietary, breath,
and other disciplines.
Furthermore, as pointed out by Wu Guang,
when Song Xing and Yin Wen advocated frugality,
this was essentially because basic human nature did not require any more,
a rationale very different from the need expressed in these "Xin shu" chapters
to rid the mind of desire along with other emotions
so that the mind and body can function properly.[^nei-ye-50]
Thus Wu Guang, along with others,
insists that these four _Guanzi_ chapters
have nothing to do with Mohism but represent later developments of Laozi's Daoism,
which, in the environment of the Jixia Academy,
came under heavy influence from Qi culture
with its traditional emphasis on *Dao* (the Way),
*li* (ritualistic principles),
and *fa* (law).[^nei-ye-51]

[^nei-ye-49]: The first article to question Guo's views that I know of
was by Zhu Ruikai,
"_Guanzi_ 'Xin shu shang,' 'xia,' deng pian fei Song Xing Yin Wen yizhu bian."
However I have never actually seen it.
Another of Zhu's works, _Xian-Qin shehui he zhuzi sixiang xintan_,
contains a chapter (pp. 192-208),
"'Xin shu shang' pai he 'Xin shu xia' pai de fenqi
ji qi dui houlai zhexue de yingxiang,"
which appears to be somewhat similar in content to his 1977 article.
In this chapter, Zhu maintains that the "Xin shu shang" and "Bai xin"
and the "Xin shu xia" and "Nei ye" chapters of the _Guanzi_
represent separate schools of pre-Qin Daoism,
the first two being an amalgam of Daoism and Legalism,
while the second two represent an amalgam of Daoism and Confucianism.

[^nei-ye-50]: Wu Guang, "_Guanzi_ sipian yu Song-Yin xuepai bianxi," 38.

[^nei-ye-51]: For other views stressing the Daoist nature of these chapters,
see Kanaya Osamu, _Kanshi no kenkyū_, 260 and 334,
Hu Jiacong, "Jixia Daojia cong Laozi zhexue jicheng bing tuiyan le shemma?"
and Xu Lijun, "'Xin shu' deng si pian shu Daojia zhuzuo."

The second view is stated most clearly by Wu Guang,
who believes that all four of these chapters
represent a development of Laozi's Daoism at the Jixia Academy.
Following a suggestion made earlier by Qiu Xigui,
he reasons that the "Xin shu shang" and "Bai xin" chapters
cannot be the work of Song Xing and Yin Wen
but rather belong to the school of two other Jixia scholars,
Shen Dao (c.360-c.285 B.C.) and his associate, Tian Pian.[^nei-ye-52]

[^nei-ye-52]: This attribution will be discussed in detail
in the introductory comments to the "Xin shu shang" and "Bai xin" chapters.

The third view has been presented best by Li Cunshan in his 1987 article
"'Nei ye' deng si pian de xiezuo shijian he zuozhe."
Li rejects the views of both Guo Moruo and Wu Guang,
maintaining that these four chapters all postdate
Mencius (371-289 B.C.) and Zhuangzi (c. 369-c. 286 B.C.).
He cites a number of brief passages in the _Zhuangzi_ that he maintains
parallel the language and thought
of the "Nei ye," "Xin shu shang" and "Bai xin" chapters.
Li maintains that the _Zhuangzi_ contains the writings
of both Zhuangzi himself and his followers who split into two groups,
one continuing the *xiaoyao* 逍遥 or "Free and Easy Wandering"
contemplative philosophy of Zhuangzi
while the other developed a *zizhi* 治世, "rectify the age," purposive approach.
It is his belief that these four _Guanzi_ chapters
represent the work of this splinter group.

None of these views do I find fully acceptable,
either because the evidence is too skimpy
or because of basic problems of methodology
such as their lumping chapters together on the basis of general similarities
without considering their differences,
treating either the _Zhuangzi_ or _Laozi_ as texts
representing the ideology of a single person or a single time,
or citing superficial similarities in wording
with little or no regard to context.[^nei-ye-53]

[^nei-ye-53]: For example, Li Cunshan (33)
cites three lines from the _Zhuangzi_
that he says show the similarity between it and the "Xin shu shang,"
1b3-4 (62.9-10):
虚其欲神將入舍,
掃除不潔神乃(=不)留處,
"Become empty of desires,
and the Spirit will enter to take up its abode.
Should you fail to make a clean sweep, the Spirit will not remain."
The first is II, 4/7al3 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 58):
唯道集處,
虚者心齋也,
"The Way gathers in emptiness alone.
Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."
Not only is the text very different,
but the _Zhuangzi_ text is taken from a paragraph that begins with Confucius saying:
"Make your will (*zhi* 志) one."
Not only is this a key term that appears in the _Mengzi_
but not in the "Xin shu shang"
or any of the "Xin shu" chapters for that matter.
See n. 33, above.
The second is II, 4/8a4-5 (Watson, 58):
夫徇耳目內外於心知鬼神而況人乎,
"Let your ears and eyes communicate with what is inside,
and put your mind and knowledge on the outside.
Then even ghosts and spirits will come to take up their abode,
not to mention men."
The third is VII, 22/24a1(Watson, 237):
攝汝知,
一汝度,
神將來舍,
"Call in your knowledge,
unify your demeanor,
and the spirits will come to take up their abode."
Li does cite some examples that are much closer,
but, while these may be used to show that these texts shared a common Daoist tradition,
they cannot be said to prove that their relationship was any other than that.

Kanaya Osamu, _Kanshi no kenkyū_, pp. 260-266,
after rejecting Guo's theories,
presents an entirely different point of view.
He believes that the "Nei ye" was put together about 250 B.C.
from materials that trace their ideological roots back to two sources,
the statements section of the "Xin shu shang,"
which predates Mencius (late fourth or early third century),
and an ancestral version of the "Xin shu xia,"
dating from about the same time but later lost.
He also believes that the explanatory section of the "Xin shu shang,"
our present "Xin shu xia," and the "Bai xin" chapters,
with their Huang-Lao orientation,
all date from the end of the Warring States period (middle third century B.C.).

In my opinion, differences in the style, language, and content
of these four chapters make it clear that they all had very different origins,
and that it is impossible to lump them together in the manner of Guo Moruo
and some of the other commentators.
The "Nei ye" is a case in point.[^nei-ye-54]
While it does speak of the sage ruler,
it does not show the concern for statecraft found in later Huang-Lao texts,
including the remaining three "Xin shu" chapters.
As mentioned above, several factors,
including the independent nature of the separate stanzas
and apparent inconsistencies in the use of terms,
have led me to believe that this "Nei ye" chapter
is but one version of a body of material
that most likely existed in an oral tradition for some time
before it was put together and written down.
Even then the nature of the text was such
that it would have been easy to add material as time went along.[^nei-ye-55]
The bulk of the material is quite early, however,
probably no later than the beginning of the fourth century B.C.
In a recent article, "Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism" (p. 16),
Harold Roth examines a number of linguistic features in the "Nei ye"
including its use of particles,
and concludes that it dates from the fourth century B.C.

[^nei-ye-54]: The other "Xin shu" chapters
will be dealt with in their own introductory comments.

[^nei-ye-55]: I suspect stanza XIII,
which consists primarily of a very Confucian-sounding passage,
stressing poetry, music, ritual principles, etc.,
is an example of this.
See n. 40, above.

Another important piece of evidence supporting an early dating
for most of the "Nei ye" is the fact that it makes no mention of Yin and Yang dualism.
The absence of such a reference is to be expected of texts
dating from the beginning of the fourth century B.C. and before,
but highly unlikely for any text dealing with the forces of the universe
written a century or so later.[^nei-ye-56]
Yin originally referred to the shady side of a hill or river bank
and Yang the sunny side.
From this, the meaning expanded to include cold and heat and atmospheric conditions.
Gradually the meanings were expanded to cover a wider range of dualisms
until Zou Yan 務衍 (c. 305-c. 240 B.C.)
and others expounded it as a philosophical system of correlates
covering the interaction of all things in the universe.
By the time the _Lüshi chunqiu_ was compiled about 240 B.C.,
it had already become a key component in all schools of Chinese thought.
The _Laozi_ mentions Yin-Yang once in chapter 42,
but this could well be one of the later chapters.
The combination also appears in two "Inner Chapters"
of the _Zhuangzi_, II, 4/8b9ff (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_ p. 59)
and III, 6/8b4 and 9b1 (Watson, pp. 84-85).
In both of these chapters
the reference is to heat and cold energies in the body.[^nei-ye-57]

[^nei-ye-56]: When speaking of Yin and Yang, Joseph Needham,
_Science and Civilisation in China_ 2:273,
concluded: "There can be little doubt that the philosophical use
of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century,
and that the passages in older texts which mention this use
are interpolations made later than that time."
A. C. Graham, _Yin-Yang and the Nature of Correlative Thinking_, 9,
expresses much the same idea.

[^nei-ye-57]: The _Mozi_ I, 6/13b7, and VII, 27/6b1 (Mei, _Motse_, 26 and 144),
also mention Yin and Yang, in what Needham,
_Science and Civilization_ 2:274, describes as a "technical sense."

In the development of Daoist thought, the "Nei ye"
would seem to come from about the same time as the oldest sections of the _Laozi_.
However, it tends to treat the basic concepts,
such as the Way and the Power, differently
and to expand on other concepts mentioned only briefly in that text.
For example, *jing*, vital essence, is mentioned
in only two chapters of the _Laozi_, 25 and 55,
the latter of which is probably late.
*Qi* vital force, appears in only three chapters, 10, 42, and 55.
In chapter 10 it has the meaning of "breath",
and in chapter 42 it refers to the Yin and Yang.
In chapter 55 it seems to refer to the vital force,
but the meaning of the line is not entirely dear.
*Xin*, "the mind," is mentioned in six chapters,
3, 8, 12, 20, 49, and 55,
but in none of them is any attempt made to develop the concept of mind
and its relations to the body or to the Power or vital force.
Furthermore, while the _Laozi_ stresses quiescence and vacuity,
it does not tie these to good health and the prolongation of life.

Although two of the later chapters of the _Zhuangzi_, IX, 28 and 29,
discuss the importance of relinquishing
the desire for material profit and political power
should one wish to prolong one's life,
nowhere in that text is there any parallel to either the treatment of the mind
or its relation to the prolongation of life
that is the main subject of "Nei ye."
Indeed, one of the primary messages of the "Inner Chapters"
of the _Zhuangzi_ is that the pursuit of long life is a meaningless endeavor.
The primary purpose of the yoga techniques practiced by Yan Hui and Huzi,
as described in chapters III, 6 and 7, of that text,
was to rise above the world and become one with the universe
rather than merely survive within it.[^nei-ye-58]
Moreover, the yoga techniques practiced by these men
seem to have been much more elaborate than
the relatively simple disciplines of the "Nei ye."
Therefore it is my belief that the "Nei ye" is the product
of an entirely separate branch of Daoism more in line with later Daoist medical texts,
such as the _Huang Di neijing suwen_,
than either the _Laozi_ or the _Zhuangzi_.[^nei-ye-59]
Particularly in the case of the _Zhuangzi_,
similarities are due primarily to these texts' sharing of
a common linguistic and cultural tradition.
If there was any direct borrowing, it was done by the writers of the _Zhuangzi_.

[^nei-ye-58]: See the _Zhuangzi_, III, 6/1452-3,
and 7/17a9-19a122 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 94-97 and 167).
