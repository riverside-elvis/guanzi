[^nei-ye-60]: The five grains are usually listed as
(1) hemp, two kinds of millet, wheat, and beans
or (2) rice, two kinds of millet, wheat, and pulse.

[^nei-ye-61]: For a discussion and partial translations of this section
and other portions of this chapter, see
Needham, _Science and Civilisation_, vols. 2 and *4fpassim*;
Graham, _Disputers of the Way_ 100-105;
and Roth, "Psychology and Self-Cultivation"
and "Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism."
Perhaps the first attempt to translate the "Nei ye" into a Western language
was made by Gustav Haloun and Joseph Needham
(see Needham, "Bibliography C," _Science and Civilisation_ 2:630),
but only the small section mentioned above was ever published.

[^nei-ye-62]: Emending 民 to 人 in accordance with the Yin Commentary [Ma Feibai].
He Ruzhang and Guo Moruo would emend 民 to 名.
The line would then read: "Thus, we call it 'vital force.'"

[^nei-ye-63]: Reading 淖 as 綽 [Ding Shihan].

[^nei-ye-64]: Guo Moruo and Zhao Shouzheng would read 卒 as 窣 and 己 as 紀.
Thus: "How lofty! As if residing on a barren peak."
The rhyme would remain the same.

[^nei-ye-65]: Emending 音 (*iəm*) to 意 (*iəy*, group 之, 3rd tone),
which completes the rhyme with 德 (*tək*, group 之, 4th tone) [Yasui and Wang Niansun].

[^nei-ye-66]: Emending 果 to 畢 in accordance with
a similar statement in the "Xin shu xia," 5b11 (66.8) [Yasui and Wang Niansun].

[^nei-ye-67]: Reading 刑 as 形 [Yasui].

[^nei-ye-68]: Deleting the 之 following 失 (*st'jiet* group 脂, 2nd tone),
in order to preserve the rhyme with 利 (*lier*, group 脂, 3rd tone),
"profit seeking" [Riegel/Haloun].

[^nei-ye-69]: Riegel/Haloum would delete the four characters 憂樂窖怒,
"sorrow and happiness, joy and anger,"
here and in the line below in order to preserve the meter.

[^nei-ye-70]: Riegel/Haloun would emend 濟 (*tser*),
"flawless state," to 齊 (*dser*).
Thus: "the mind will return to a state of equilibrium (齊 *dser*)."

[^nei-ye-71]: Emending 折折 to 晳晳 [Ding Shihan].

[^nei-ye-72]: Following the interpretation of
Guo Moruo, Ma Feibai, and Zhao Shouzheng.
Zhang Peilun, Xu Weiyu, and Riegel/Haloun
would emend 稽 to 道 so that the sentence would read:
"This Way is never far and we may daily use its Power."
Were this emendation adopted,
this and the preceding three lines
would form the opening lines of stanza III, below.

[^nei-ye-73]: Deleting the two characters 者 and 也
in order to preserve the meter [Riegel/Haloun].
As mentioned previously,
the meaning of *xing* 形 is often unclear in this chapter.
Since the following passage speaks of the Way as residing in the mind,
I have read here as referring
to the mind's gestalt rather than the body's physical form.

[^nei-ye-74]: Reading 謀 as 漠 [Chen Huan].

[^nei-ye-75]: A somewhat similar description of the Way
appears in the "Jie Lao" 解老 [Explanation of the _Laozi_]
chapter of _Hanfeizi_, VI, 20/8b10-12 (Liao, _Han Fei Tzu_ 1:192-193):
"Should you consider it near,
it roams the four limits of the universe.
Should you consider it far,
it is always at your side.
Should you consider it dark,
its light shines brilliantly.
Should you consider it bright,
its being is obscure."

[^nei-ye-76]: Both the Yang and Zhao editions
break the text beginning with this line to form a new section.

[^nei-ye-77]: Emending 愛 (*·ər*) to 處 (*t'jay*)
to complete the rhyme with (所 *·siay*), above
[Wang Niansun, Tao Hongqing, and Guo Moruo].

[^nei-ye-78]: Reading 產 as 生 [Ma Feibai].

[^nei-ye-79]: Following Guo Moruo in emending 知 (*tiey*),
"knowledge" or "ability to know,"
to 和 (*gwa*) to complete the rhyme with 離 (*lia*).

[^nei-ye-80]: Rhyme: 索 (group 魚, 4th tone) 所 (group 魚, 2nd tone), below.

[^nei-ye-81]: The Yang edition mistakenly writes 被 for 彼.

[^nei-ye-82]: Rhyme: 意 (之 group, 3rd tone) with 得 (group 之, 4th tone), below.

[^nei-ye-83]: The _Huainanzi_, 12/1b6-7 (Morgan, _Tao, The Great Luminant_, 103), says:
"The Way cannot be heard.
If it is heard, it is not the true Way.
The Way cannot be seen.
If it is seen, it is not the true Way.
The Way cannot be expressed.
If it is expressed, it is not the true Way.
Who understands the formlessness of its form?"

[^nei-ye-84]: Again the meaning of 形 is not clear.
Zhao Shouzheng follows the Yin commentary in reading it as physical form.
Thus: "It is the means to cultivate one's mind and rectify one's physical form."

[^nei-ye-85]: This passage is somewhat similar
to a passage in the "Dao fa" 道法 section of the Mawangdui _Jing fa_, 1:
"Therefore all things emerge in the same manner
from the true profoundness [of the Way]
whether to die or whether to live,
whether to fail or whether to succeed."

[^nei-ye-86]: Both the Yang and Zhao editions
break the text with this line to begin a new section.
Ma Feibai follows suit to begin a new stanza.
Riegel/Haloun and Zhao Shouzheng would include this stanza in the preceding one.
Shi Yishen believes it represents a misplaced slip
and should be inserted in line 1b10 (100.1)
after 日用其德, "we may daily use its Power."

[^nei-ye-87]: 正 here refers to the Heaven's regularity in respect to the seasons.
Below, it refers to good judgment in people.

[^nei-ye-88]: I.e., it provides support equally to all living things.

[^nei-ye-89]: Emending 枝 to 材 (*dzəy*),
which completes the rhyme with 時 *diəy* [Wang Niansun].

[^nei-ye-90]: Inserting 遷 following 物
in accordance with the Yin commentary [Xu Weiyu].

[^nei-ye-91]: These two sentences are similar in content
to the "Xin shu xia" 7a10 (67.12).

[^nei-ye-92]: 正. This refers to the above statement that the sage,
"in accordance with the times,
is ever changing,
but never transformed.
In responding to things,
he is ever flexible,
but never inconsistent."

[^nei-ye-93]: Irregular rhyme: 中 (group 中)with 明 (group 暘), below.

[^nei-ye-94]: Reading 道 as 通 [Dai Wang].

[^nei-ye-95]: This stanza is somewhat similar in content
to two paragraphs in the "Xin shu xia," 6b4-10 (67.3-5).
However, for 神, "Spirit,"
that chapter writes 精, "vital essence."

[^nei-ye-96]: For a discussion of the meaning of "the One,"
see the section on key terms in the introductory comments and n. 38, above.

[^nei-ye-97]: Irregular rhyme:
失 (group 脂, 2nd tone) with 物 (group 微, 4th tone), below.

[^nei-ye-98]: I have not been able to find this precise saying in any other text.
However, H. G. Creel's reconstruction of the _Shenzi_, frag. 4 (_Shen Pu-hai_, 353),
contains a somewhat similar statement concerning the rule of an enlightened prince:
"His single word being correct,
the world is well regulated."
Frag. 5 (p. 354) also says:
"His single word being correct,
the world stands firm."

[^nei-ye-99]: Again the meaning of 形 in this sentence and the one below
is not entirely clear.
In both cases I have read it as referring to the mind's gestalt,
but Zhao Shouzheng believes it refers to one's physical form or outward appearance.
Cf. the "Xin shu xia," 5b9-6a2 (66.7-9),
which is very similar in content and wording to stanza VII.2.

[^nei-ye-100]: Emending 至 (*tjier*) to 來 (*ləi*, group 之, 1st tone)
in accordance with the "Xin shu xia," 5b11 (66.8),
and completing the rhyme with 得 (*tək*, group 之, 4th tone), above [Riegel/Haloun].
The meaning remains essentially the same.

[^nei-ye-101]: Riegel/Haloun would emend 明之 to 莫知
and delete 乎 to made this sentence conform to a similar passage
in the "Xin shu xia," 5b11-12 (66.8).
Thus: "No one understands the Spirit's supremacy,
but it is brilliant in knowing the entire world."

[^nei-ye-102]: Deleting 義 as
an interpolation taken from the line above [Wang Niansun and Ma Feibai].

[^nei-ye-103]: The "Xin shu xia," 6a2 (67.9),
for *zhong de* 中得, lit., "inner obtainment,"
writes 内德, "having the Power within."
*Zhong* and *nei* have essentially the same meaning,
while the two *de* characters are often subject to a play on words.
According to the "Xin shu xia," 3b11 (64.10):
"Therefore Power 德
is obtainment 得
and obtainment refers to obtaining the means for things to be what they are."

[^nei-ye-104]: Deleting 身 in accordance with the rhyme pattern [Guo Moruo].

[^nei-ye-105]: I.e., the mind.
According to the "Xin shu xia," 1b4-5 (62.10):
"Become empty of desires,
and the Spirit will enter to take up its abode.
Should you fail to make a clean sweep,
the Spirit will not remain."
Line 2a5-6 (63.2-3) also says:
"Cleanse the mansion of your mind
and open the gates of perception!
When you rid yourself of selfish desires and stop talking,
the Spirit will appear."
The explanation for this statement (4b4; 65.5)
explains that "mansion" refers to the mind.

[^nei-ye-106]: Emending 精 to 靜.
精 was assimilated from the line above.

[^nei-ye-107]: Zhao Shouzheng would end the stanza with the phrase
耳目不淫 , "your eyes and ears will never go astray,"
and begin a new stanza with 心無他用.
Thus: "Do not let your mind become occupied with irrelevant concerns.
When a stable mind lies within,
all things attain their proper measure."
However, Zhao's punctuation would destroy the rhyme and meter.

[^nei-ye-108]: Emending 正 to 定 in accordance with the above passage, 2b8-9 (100.14):
"There being a stable mind within,
his (the sage) ears and eyes are sharp and clear."
Yu Yue (see _Guanzi jijiao_ 2:656) would read 正 as 誠, "sincere."

[^nei-ye-109]: The opening passage of this stanza
is summarized in the concluding sentence of the "Xin shu xia," 8a10-11 (68.10).

[^nei-ye-110]: Riegel/Haloun would delete these three opening lines
as commentary later inserted into the text.
They may be correct.
The rhyming of 所 (group 魚) with 知 (group 佳) is not at all common.

[^nei-ye-111]: This passage is similar to one in the "Cheng fa" 成法 section
of the Mawangdui *Shi da jing* (_Shiliu jing_), 74:
"With the One understood,
one may explore Heaven and Earth;
by grasping its inherent principles,
one may reach everywhere within the four seas."
The _Huainanzi_, 1/1b7 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, 18),
and the _Wenzi_, A/4b11-12, both contain somewhat similar statements.

[^nei-ye-112]: Following Guo Moruo,
who would emend 安 (*·an*) to 治 (*diəy*)
in order to preserve the rhyme with rhyme with 之 (*tjiəy*), above.
Zhang Peilun and Xu Weiyu would deiete 安
as an interpolation taken from the following passage, 3b9-10 (101.13).
Thus, "This lies in the mind."

[^nei-ye-113]: I.e., within the thinking mind
there is a deeper mind that can control the thinking mind and thought processes.

[^nei-ye-114]: This passage,
彼心之心音以先言,
言然後形,
形然後言,
言然後使,
使然後治, 
which is somewhat similar to VIII, 37/8a4-7 (2:68.7-8),
is clearly corrupt.
I have followed Guo Moruo in emending the first 音 to 意
and the first 言 to 音 (*·iəm*)
in order to preserve the rhyme with 心 (*sjiəm*).
Since in the following phrase 言 (*ngja*)
fails to rhyme with 形 (*geng*),
he would also emend the two 言 to 名 (*mgieng*).
Liu Ji, Wang Niansun, and Zhang Peilun
would emend the two characters 音, "sound," to 意, "power of awareness,"
in accordance with a similar passage in the "Xin shu xia," 8a5 (68.7).
Thus: "In the mind's mind,
the power of awareness comes before words.
After awareness come forms.
After forms come words.
After words come putting the mind to use.
After putting the mind to use comes its regulation."

[^nei-ye-115]: Cf. a somewhat similar passage in the "Xin shu xia," 8a7-9 (68.8-10).

[^nei-ye-116]: *Hao ran* 浩然.
This appears to be a common descriptive term.
The _Mengzi_, IIA, 2/9,
uses it to describe the vital force.
See n. 33, above.

[^nei-ye-117]: Irregular rhyme:
淵 (group 其) with 原 (group 元), above.
Riegel/Haloun, in accordance with the corresponding statement
in the "Xin shu xia" 8a7-8 (68.9),
would emend 淵 , both here and below, to 泉 (*dzjiwan*), "fountain,"
thus maintaining a regular rhyme with 原.

[^nei-ye-118]: The four parts of the body are
arms, legs, head, and trunk.

[^nei-ye-119]: Emending 通 (*t'ewng*) to 達
in order to preserve the rhyme with 竭 (*giat*)
[Wang Niansun, Yasui, Tao Hongqing, and Xu Weiyu].
The meaning is essentially the same.

[^nei-ye-120]: For a somewhat abbreviated version of this portion of stanza IX,
see the "Xin shu xia," 7a11-7b2 (67.12-14).

[^nei-ye-121]: The parallel sentence in the "Xin shu xia," 7a11 (67.12),
for 信 (=伸) writes □, "firm."
[I can't find the missing character,
but it might be 肋 or 肒. --RSE]

[^nei-ye-122]: The "Xin shu xia," 7a11 (67.13), for 圜 writes 圓.

[^nei-ye-123]: The "Great Circle" refers to Heaven
and the "Great Square" to Earth.

[^nei-ye-124]: The "Xin shu xia," 7a12 (67.13),
for 鑒 writes 鏡,
as does the text cited below.
The translation remains the same.

[^nei-ye-125]: The _Huainanzi_, 2/4a1-3 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, 36),
contains a somewhat similar passage in reference to the sage:
是故能戴大貝者履大方,
鏡太清者視大明,
立太平者處大堂
"For this reason,
being one who is able to wear on his head the Great Circle,
he plants his feet on the Great Square,
finding his reflection in the Great Purity,
he is comparable to the great luminaries,
establishing great peace,
he occupies the great hall."
The "Great Purity" is the Way;
the "great luminaries" are the sun and moon.
For further discussion,
see the "Xin shu xia," n. 32.

[^nei-ye-126]: The meaning of these final two lines is not clear.
I have followed Guo Moruo in emending
the next to the last character, 之, to 亡 = 無.

[^nei-ye-127]: Both the Yang and Zhao editions
break the text and begin a new section with this line.
Harold Roth, "Psychology and Self- Cultivation," 618,
adopts a rather radical interpretation for this passage,
maintaining that it refers to a form of breath control meditation:
"In general [to practice] this Way,
One must coil, one must contract.
One must uncoil, one must expand,
And one must be firm and regular [in this practice]."
My translation accords with that of Ma Feibai, Zhao Shouzheng,
and other Chinese commentators in respect to reading Dao 道, "the Way,"
as the subject of the passage,
but Ma and Zhao would interpret 周 and 密 as "all-embracing yet finely textured."

[^nei-ye-128]: Emending 澤 to 釋 [Liu Ji, Chen Huan, and Li Zheming].

[^nei-ye-129]: Rhyme: 薄 (group 魚, 4th tone) with 舍 (group 魚, 3rd tone), above.

[^nei-ye-130]: The "Xin shu xia," 7b2 (67.14),
for 全 writes 金, "metal."
Both characters should probably be emended to 定
in accordance with the above passage, 2b8-9 (100.14):
"There being a stable mind within,
his (the sage) ears and eyes are sharp and clear."
The remainder of this stanza
is somewhat similar to the "Xin shu xia," 7b2~10 (67.14-68.4).

[^nei-ye-131]: Emending 和 to 知
in accordance with the similar passage in "Xin shu xia," 7b4 (68.1)
[Liu Ji and Wang Niansun].

[^nei-ye-132]: _Lei gu_ 雷鼓 may also refer to a large,
eight-sided drum used during sacrificial ceremonies to summon the spirits.

[^nei-ye-133]: Emending 過 (*kwa*), "mistakes,"
to 惡 (*·ak*) [Guo Moruo].
惡 completes the rhyme with  (*bjwak*), below.

[^nei-ye-134]: The meaning of the two expressions 氣意,
"awareness of the vital force,"
and 心意, "awareness of the mind,"
appearing in this and the following line, is not clear.
Ma Feibai says that they refer to the use of
spiritual and psychological approaches to government.
Zhang Peilun would emend the two 意 characters to 壹.
Thus the translation would be:
"unification of the vital force"
and "unification of the mind."

[^nei-ye-135]: The Yang and the Zhao (Ming print) editions,
both here and in the following line,
mistakenly write 撙 for 博 = 專 [Liu Ji,Wang Niansun, Yasui,and Guo Moruo].

[^nei-ye-136]: This portion of stanza XI
is similar in content to the "Xin shu xia," 6a9-6b3 (66.13-67.2).

[^nei-ye-137]: Irregular rhyme: 神 (group 其) with 存 (group 文).

[^nei-ye-138]: Again, the meaning of 一 presents a problem.
I have read it in accordance with a statement
farther along in this stanza (5a8; 103.3):
一意搏(專)心,
"You will focus (i.e., unify) your power of awareness
and concentrate your mind."
Such an interpretation is further supported
by somewhat similar passages in the "Xin shu xia" 6a9-10 (66.13)
and the "Shun dao" 艰道 section of
the Mawangdui _Shi da jing_ (_Shiliu jing_), 88:
"Can you focus?
Can you desist?
Can you rise above yourself?
Can you make decisions on your own
while honoring the inherent order of things?"
However, in the _Zhuangzi_,  VIII, 23/4b7-10 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 253),
there is another passage very similar in content
that contains the phrase 錶抱一乎.
In this case, 一 is clearly a noun
and refers to "the One"
(perhaps the Way
or perhaps true human nature
or the undivided state underlying one's consciousness).
The _Zhuangzi_ passage reads:
"Laozi said, 'The cardinal precept in preserving life is---Can
you embrace the One and never lose it?
Without resorting to tortoise shell and milfoil,
can you foretell good fortune from bad?
Can you tell where to stop?
Can you tell when to desist?
Can you disregard it in others and seek it within yourself?"

[^nei-ye-139]: Inverting the two characters 吉凶
in accordance with the parallel passage in the "Xin shu xia," 6a11 (66.14),
and to preserve the rhyme with 一 (*·jiet*) [Wang Niansun and Yasui].

[^nei-ye-140]: The Yang edition mistakenly deletes 得.

[^nei-ye-141]: Irregular rhyme: 近 (group 文) with 淫 (group 侵), above.

[^nei-ye-142]: Irregular rhyme: 死 (group 脂, 2nd tone)
with 疾 (group 脂, 4th tone) above.

[^nei-ye-143]: Irregular rhyme: 薄 (group 魚, 4th tone)
with 拾 (group 魚, 1st tone), above.

[^nei-ye-144]: Emending 精 to 情 [Yasui, Dai Wang, and Guo Moruo].

[^nei-ye-145]: Emending  論治 to 淪洽 [Guo Moruo].

[^nei-ye-146]: Emending 忿 to 窖 in accordance with the text below [Ding Shihan].

[^nei-ye-147]: The five desires stem from the action of the five organs:
ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and heart/mind,
and involve hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and love and hate.

[^nei-ye-148]: The two violent emotions are joy and anger.

[^nei-ye-149]: This stanza is similar in content
to a paragraph in the "Xin shu xia," 7b11-8a2 (68.4-6).

[^nei-ye-150]: This Confucian-sounding passage
may well represent a later addition.
See n. 40, above.

[^nei-ye-151]: The writing of
大充傷而不臧
is clearly corrupt.
I have followed Li Zheming in emending this line to
大充氣傷而形不藏.
According to the _Lüshi chunqiu_, I, 3/7b10-12
(Wilhelm, _Frühling und Herbst_, 8):
"If a person tastes a great many delicacies,
his stomach will be stuffed.
When stuffed,
the insides will be stretched too tightly.
When they are stretched too tightly,
the breath cannot circulate.
If such a state continues for long,
can life be maintained?"

[^nei-ye-152]: Emending 長 to 忘 ,
both here and below [Guo Moruo].
Ma Feibai would leave the sentence as is,
reading it as:
"When old,
put a premium on (i.e., be sparing in) your mental effort."
See n. 155, below.

[^nei-ye-153]: Emending 飽 to 飢 [Yu Yue].

[^nei-ye-154]: Rhyme:
廢 (group 祭, 3rd tone) with 末 ( group 祭, 4th tone), above,
and 竭 (group 祭, 4th tone), below.

[^nei-ye-155]: As mentioned above,
Ma Feibai would leave 長 in the previous sentence as is,
but he would emend 困 here to 囦 = 淵.
Thus this sentence would read:
"If being old,
you do not put a premium on your mental effort,
the wellspring will be quickly exhausted."

[^nei-ye-156]: Emending 敢 to 敞 [He Ruzhang].

[^nei-ye-157]: Irregular rhyme:
懼 (group 魚) with 誘 (group 之), above.

[^nei-ye-158]: Reading 雲 as 云 = 運 [Yasui and Guo Moruo].

[^nei-ye-159]: According to the _Mengzi_, IIA, 6/5-7,
man has the four beginnings (*si duan* 四端) of virtue:
"A feeling of commiseration (*ce yin* 惻隱)
is the beginning of humaneness (*ren* 仁),
a sense of shame and disgrace (*xue e* 羞惡)
is the beginning of a sense of duty (*yi* 義),
a sense of modesty and yielding (*ci rang* 辭讓)
is the beginning of propriety (*li* 禮)
and a sense of right and wrong (*shi fei* 是非)
is the beginning of wisdom (*zhi* 智).

[^nei-ye-160]: Reading 遇 as 愚 [Yasui, Zhang Binglin, and Xu Weiyu].

[^nei-ye-161]: According to the "Xin shu xia," 2a8 (64.2):
"The Way lies between Heaven and Earth.
It is so large that nothing exists beyond it.
It is so small that nothing exists within it."

[^nei-ye-162]: Reading 丞 as 烝 [Wang Yinzhi].

[^nei-ye-163]: Following Wang Yinzhi
who would emend 屯 to 毛
in accordance with another version of this statement
appearing in the _Huainanzi_, 20/3a2-5:
"Now a person who adheres to the Way
stores the vital essence within [his body]
and retains the Spirit in his mind.
He is quiet and still,
and happiness (訟 = 説) lies within his breast.
A harmful vital force has no place to stay or congeal.
His four limbs are as close-knit as the joint and tendon.
The lines [of his face] exude [harmony];
his hair effuses it.
Thus his essential parts are harmonious and well functioning
and his hundred veins and nine apertures all operate together."
