昭知天下
通於四極
But it is brilliant in knowing the entire world[^xin-shu-xia-13]

The vital force
is what fills the self.[^xin-shu-xia-15]

Good judgment
should be the guiding principle of conduct.[^xin-shu-xia-16]

If what fills the self is not good,
the mind will not function properly. (得 *tək*)

則民不服
If conduct lacks good judgment,
the people will not be submissive. (服 *bjwək*)
