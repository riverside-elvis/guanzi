# Appendix: Introduction to the "Xin Shu Xia"

## Introductory Comments

As discussed in the introductory comments to the "Nei ye" 内業 (XVI, 49),
this relatively short chapter is closely associated with that text,
frequently quoting passages to be found there,
even to the point of prefacing them with the phrase
故曰, "therefore it is said."
It is partially in rhyme,
especially when it seems to be quoting or paraphrasing the "Nei ye,"
but most of it is in unrhymed prose.
The rhymes are discussed in the introductory comments to the "Nei ye."

Also discussed in the introductory comments to the "Nei ye"
is Guo Moruo's elaborate thesis concerning the relationship
between the "Nei ye" and the "Xin shu xia,"
in which he maintains that the latter was the original draft of the former.
According to Guo, the "Xin shu xia" was badly damaged in transmission,
with only its central section still in existence
by the time it reached Liu Xiang 劉向 about 26 B.C.
Furthermore, its surviving slips were supposedly so scrambled
that the order of its content had come to differ considerably
from that of the "Nei ye."
That the text was damaged in transmission may well be true,
but that scrambled slips account for the difference in order is untenable.
If the slips were scrambled,
the text could not have the internal cohesiveness that it does now.
It is true that the surviving "Xin shu xia"
deals with various divisions of the "Nei ye,"
in an order very different
from that of our current _Guanzi_ text.[^xin-shu-xia-1]
However, the existing text not only is quite readable
but hangs together much better than the "Nei ye,"
which has rather loosely connected separate stanzas.

[^xin-shu-xia-1]: The order in which the "Xin shu xia" treats
the various divisions of the "Nei ye" is
VII.2,
XI.1,
VII.1,
VI.2,
IX.1,
X.2,
VIII.2-3,
VII.1,
V1II.4,
VIII.1.

Actually there are a number of important differences
between these two texts that suggest not only that the "Xin shu xia"
is a much later composition than the "Nei ye,"
most likely second century B.C. Han, 
but also that it was based on a version of that text
that was at least somewhat different from the one we have surviving today.
The "Xin shu xia" discusses concepts
that are not mentioned in the "Nei ye,"
and that represent relatively late developments
in Warring States philosophy,
such as the relationship between names and realities.[^xin-shu-xia-2]
Furthermore, as Harold Roth,
in his "Psychology and Self-Cultivation" (p. 626),
very astutely points out,
while the "Nei ye" itself
makes virtually no effort to tie self-cultivation
to the problems of government,
about 35 percent of the "Xin shu xia"
is devoted to making this connection.
Both of these differences are in line
with the later development of Huang-Lao 黃老 thought.

[^xin-shu-xia-2]: See the following translation, 6a7-9 (66.12-13).

There are also major differences in style.
The "Xin shu xia" is only partially in rhyme,
and where rhyme occurs,
the meter is often different from that of the "Nei ye."
Moreover, when the "Xin shu xia" is clearly quoting the "Nei ye,"
it frequently uses different words and phrases.
For example, the "Xin shu xia," 6a2 (66.9),
writes
此之謂内德
for the "Nei ye," 3a12 (101.8),
是謂中得.
Perhaps the most revealing of these differences
comes in a "Xin shu xia" (7 a11-7b1; 67.13)
paraphrase of "Nei ye," stanza XI.1 (4 a11-12; 102.6),
concerning the man who is quiescent
being able to wear on his head the Great Circle (Heaven),
plant his feet on the Great Square (Earth),
and find his reflection in the Great Purity (the Way).
In this case, the "Xin shu xia" inserts a particle, 者, 
that alters the meaning so that it duplicates
the wording of a similar statement in the _Huainanzi_.
It also uses the alternate characters for circle and mirror,
to be found in that text.[^xin-shu-xia-3]

[^xin-shu-xia-3]: See "Xin shu xia," n. 32, below.

Thus, it is my belief that the "Xin shu xia"
is a much later explication or rewriting
of an entirely different version of the "Nei ye,"
one that had perhaps been damaged and lost its beginning and end
before it came into the hands of the author of the "Xin shu xia."
Most likely there were at least two versions of the "Nei ye"
in existence during the early Han:
one that probably came into the Han imperial library
from the archives of the old state of Qi 齊
(i.e., our existing version of the text),
and another that ended up in the library of Liu An 劉安 (180-122 B.C.), 
King of Huainan 淮南,
whose scholars specialized in collecting and working on texts
associated with Chu 楚 tradition.[^xin-shu-xia-4]
It was this group of Huainan scholars,
working under Liu An,
that produced the _Huainanzi_
as well as a number of other texts,
most of which are no longer positively identifiable.
In my opinion, the "Xin shu xia" and the explanatory section 
of the "Xin shu shang" 心術上 (XIII, 36)
should be included among them.[^xin-shu-xia-5]
After the death of Liu An,
his library was transferred to the imperial library in Chang'an 長安, 
where it was catalogued and many of its works
were edited by Liu Xiang.[^xin-shu-xia-6]
It is impossible to know what condition the Huainan library version
of the "Nei ye" was in at this point.
Most likely it was in very poor condition or even lost,
otherwise Liu Xiang would probably have kept it
rather than the Qi version.
The fact that Liu Xiang rejected the Huainan version,
if indeed it still existed,
in favor of the Qi version
would account for the "Nei ye" and other "Xin shu" chapters
appearing in such widely separate sections of the _Guanzi_.[^xin-shu-xia-7]

[^xin-shu-xia-4]: The "Treatise on Literature,"
of the _Qian-Han shu_ 30/14a7,
lists a "Nei ye" in fifteen *pian* by an unknown author.
Since this text has completely disappeared,
it is impossible to tell whether or not
it was another version of our text that circulated
independently of the _Guanzi_ collection.
This happened with other _Guanzi_ chapters,
such as the "Dizi zhi"  弟子職 (XIX, 59).
It is worth noting, perhaps,
that this "Treatise on Literature,"
"Nei ye," had fifteen *pian*,
the same number of stanzas into which our current text
has been divided by Ma Feibai and Shi Yishen.

[^xin-shu-xia-5]: The argument for a Huainan, or at least Chu,
origin for the "Xin shu xia" is strengthened by the fact
that the "Xin shu xia" contains two passages similar
in wording to statements appearing in the _Shi da jing_ or _Shiliu jing_ text
prefixed to the Mawangdui _Laozi_ manuscript.
See the "Xin shu xia," nn. 21 and 47.

[^xin-shu-xia-6]: For more details, see my 1985 _Guanzi_, 22-23.

[^xin-shu-xia-7]: In his article,
"Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism,"
Harold Roth examines a number of linguistic features
in the "Nei ye" and "Xin shu xia" and concludes that the former
indeed dates from the fourth century B.C.
while the latter may be as late as the early Han.
His views concerning the nature of the "Xin shu xia," however,
differ  considerably from mine.
He (p. 14) rejects my suggestion that the "Xin shu xia"
consists of an explication and development of ideas
contained in another damaged version of the "Nei ye,"
and believes instead that it is
"an original prose essay in which the author
deliberately extracted and rearranged the verses from the "Nei yeh"
for the purpose of advocating the techniques and philosophy
of inner cultivation as part of the arcana of rulership."
To my mind this is a highly plausible theory,
but I feel that it fails to provide an adequate explanation
for the fact that our surviving "Nei ye" appears
in an entirely different section of the _Guanzi_,
far removed from the other "Xin shu" texts,
or why the "Xin shu xia" should quote the "Nei ye"
using the language of the _Huainanzi_
rather than the "Nei ye" itself.
