[^xin-shu-xia-8]: The meaning of 形
in this paragraph is not entirely clear.
Zhao Shouzheng and others would interpret it
to refer to the physical form or outward appearance.
However, it appears to me that the context of this paragraph
and the section of the "Nei ye" to which it is related
is dealing primarily with the mind.
See stanza VII.2 of the "Nei ye" 3a7-12 (101.6-8).

[^xin-shu-xia-9]: Emending 精 to 靜
in accordance with the "Nei ye," 3a8 (101.6).

[^xin-shu-xia-10]: Reading 飾 as 飭.
The "Nei ye," 3a8 (101.6), for 師 writes 攝, "hold onto."

[^xin-shu-xia-11]: It would appear that several characters
are missing from the text here.
The comparable passage in the "Nei ye," 3a8-9 (101.6),
writes:
天仁地義則淫然而自來,
"The beneficence of Heaven
and the righteousness of Earth
in bounteous fashion
will naturally arrive."

[^xin-shu-xia-12]: Irregular rhyme:
來 (group 之, 1st tone) with 得 (group 之, 4th tone), above.

[^xin-shu-xia-13]: The "Nei ye, " 3a10 (101.7),
for 天下 writes 萬物, "all things."

[^xin-shu-xia-14]: The "Nei ye," 3a11-12 (101.8),
for 内德 (*nei de*) writes 中得 (*zhong de*),
"inner obtainment" or "internalization" [of the Spirit].
*Zhong* and *nei* have essentially the same meaning,
while the two de characters are often subject to a play on words.
According to the "Xin shu shang," 3b11 (64.10):
"Therefore, Power 德 is obtainment 得,
and obtainment refers to obtaining
the means for things to be what they are."

[^xin-shu-xia-15]: According to the _Mengzi_, IIA, 2/9:
"The vital force is what fills the body."

[^xin-shu-xia-16]: Emending
行者正之義 to
正者行之義也 [Guo Muorou].
This and the preceding line break the normal rhyme pattern
and it is possible that they were originally marginal notes
that were later incorporated into the text.

[^xin-shu-xia-17]: Reading *cai* 財 as *cai* 裁 [Liu Ji].

[^xin-shu-xia-18]: Reading 傷 as 爽 [Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-xia-19]: This and the following paragraph
are similar in content to stanza XI.1 of the "Nei ye," 5a1-8 (102.14-103.4).

[^xin-shu-xia-20]: Emending 證 to 近
and reading 之 as 若
in accordance with a similar statement
in the "Nei ye," 5a8 (103.4) [Xu Weiyu and Guo Moruo].
近 (group 文) forms an irregular rhyme with 心 (group 侵), above.

[^xin-shu-xia-21]: A somewhat similar statement
appears in the "Shun dao" 順道 section of the Mawangdui
_Shi da jing_ (_Shiliu jing_) 88:
"Can you focus?
Can you desist?
Can you rise above yourself?
Can you make decisions on your own
while honoring the inherent order of things?"

[^xin-shu-xia-22]: What follows differs somewhat in wording
from the comparable passage in stanza XI.1 of the "Nei ye, " 5a4-6 (103.2-3).

[^xin-shu-xia-23]: This and the following paragraph
are similar in content to stanza VII. 1 of the "Nei ye," 3a1-7 (101.2-6).
However, for this sentence, the "Nei ye," 3a1 (101.2), writes:
"What is at one with things 物
and is able to bring about their transformation 化
is called the Spirit 神."

[^xin-shu-xia-24]: Emending 慕 to 募
in accordance with the Yin commentary in the Liu and Zhu editions [Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-xia-25]: As pointed out by Liu Ji, Dai Wang, and Wu Rulun,
some characters appear to be missing from the phrase
執一之君子.
I have followed the wording of the "Nei ye," 3a 3 (101.4):
惟執一之君子能為此乎.
The meaning of 執一, "grasps the One,"
is not entirely clear.
The _Laozi_, A, 10/5a (Waley, _The Way and Its Power_, 153),
and _the_ Zhuangzi, VIII, VIII, 23/4b7 (Watson, _Chuang Tzu_, 253),
in a similar context write 抱一, "embrace the One."
The _Laozi_ commentator Wang Bi 王弼 (A.D. 226-249)
explains "One" as meaning man's true nature.
Waley (p. 154) explains it as
"the undivided state that underlies the normal consciousness."
Another possible interpretation for 執一 would be
"holds to a single purpose."

[^xin-shu-xia-26]: The Yang edition mistakenly deletes 於.

[^xin-shu-xia-27]: Emending 不 to 丕 [Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-xia-28]: Emending 利 to 制 [Guo Moruo].

[^xin-shu-xia-29]: A statement similar to these two phrases
appears in stanza VI.2 of the "Nei ye," 2b6-7 (100.13-14),
but the subject is the sage himself.

[^xin-shu-xia-30]: The writing of 化, "transformed,"
here may be a mistake even though it does preserve the rhyme
with the two previous phrases.
Guo Moruo would delete the entire line as a marginal note
by some later commentator.
Thus the passage would simply read:
"It is ever changing in accordance with the times,
yet is never transformed.
It is ever responsive to things,
yet is never inconsistent."

[^xin-shu-xia-31]: This paragraph is very similar in content and wording
to stanza IX. 1 of the "Nei ye," 4a5-4b1 (102.5-6).

[^xin-shu-xia-32]: The character 者 in this and the following sentence,
能戴大圓者體乎大方鏡大清者視乎大明,
presents a problem since it turns what should be a simple statement
into one that is causal.
The "Nei ye" writes:
乃能戴大圓而履大方鑒於大清視於大明,
"Thus he is able to wear on his head the Great Circle (Heaven)
and plant his feet on the Great Square (Earth),
find his reflection in the Great Purity (the Way)
and be comparable to the great luminaries (the sun and moon)."
Tao Hongqing would delete the two 者
as interpolations taken from the opening phrase of the previous sentence,
人能正靜者.
However, 者 appears in a very similar passage describing the sage
in the _Huainanzi_, 2/4a1-3 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, 36):
是故能
戴大員者履大方,
鏡太清者視大明,
立太平者處大堂, 
"For this reason,
being one who is able to wear on his head the Great Circle,
he plants his feet on the Great Square;
finding his reflection in the Great Purity,
he is comparable to the great luminaries;
establishing the great peace,
he occupies the great hall."
It is possible that the _Huainanzi_ version was based on the "Xin shu xia,"
but it seems more likely that both the _Huainanzi_ and "Xin shu xia" versions
were based on another text similar in content to the "Nei ye"
but different in wording and organization.

[^xin-shu-xia-33]: For 體, both the "Nei ye" and _Huainanzi_
write 履, "plant his feet on."

[^xin-shu-xia-34]: Emending 金, both here and below, to 全 in accordance
with the "Nei ye," 4b5 (102.10) [Liu Ji, Hong Yixuan, and Igai].
Yu Yue and Xu Weiyu would emend it to 正 = 誠, "sincere."

[^xin-shu-xia-35]: The following paragraph is very similar
in content and wording to stanza X.2 of the "Nei ye," 4b5-9 (102.10-12).

[^xin-shu-xia-36]: *Lei gu* 雷鼓 may also refer to a large,
eight-sided drum used during sacrificial ceremonies to summon the spirits.

[^xin-shu-xia-37]: Emending 貨 to 賞 [Yu Yue].
The "Nei ye," 4b10-11 (102.13), states:
"Rewards are not enough to encourage goodness.
Punishments are not enough to discipline evil."
The character 惡, with different pronunciations,
can mean either "hatred" or "evil."

[^xin-shu-xia-38]: The Yang edition mistakenly writes 乎 for 平.
This paragraph is similar in content to stanza XIII
of the "Nei ye," 5b11-6a2 (103.11-13).

[^xin-shu-xia-39]: This and the following two sentences
are somewhat similar in form to stanza VIII.2-3
of the "Nei ye," 3b9-4a1 (101.13-102.1).

[^xin-shu-xia-40]: The comparable passage in the "Nei ye"
is obviously corrupt. I have followed Guo Morou in emending it to read:
"In that mind's mind,
awareness 意 comes before sound 音.
After awareness come forms 形.
After forms come names 名.
After names comes putting the mind to use 使.
After putting the mind to use comes its regulation 治."

[^xin-shu-xia-41]: The Yang edition mistakenly writes 刑 for 形.

[^xin-shu-xia-42]: The final sentence of this paragraph appears to explicate
the concluding sentence of stanza VI.3 of the "Nei ye," 2b12 (101.2).

[^xin-shu-xia-43]: This paragraph is similar in content
to the "Nei ye," 4a3-7 (102.2-4).

[^xin-shu-xia-44]: Emending 通 (*t'ewng*) to 達 (*dat*)
to preserve the rhyme with 竭 (*giat*), "exhausted" [Wang Niansun].
According to the "Nei ye," 4a6 (102.3) it is the passages
of the nine apertures that will remain clear.

[^xin-shu-xia-45]: Rhyme:
涸 (group 魚, 4th tone)
with 固 (group 魚, 3rd tone)
and 圄 (group 魚, 2nd tone), below.

[^xin-shu-xia-46]: Emending 固 to 圄 [Wang Niansun].
According to the "Nei ye," 4a6-7 (102.3-4):
"Thus it is possible to explore the limits of Heaven and Earth
and cover the four seas."

[^xin-shu-xia-47]: According to the "Nei ye," 3b/7 (101.11-12):
"The Way fills the whole world,
existing wherever people dwell.
Yet people are incapable of knowing it.
With one word understood,
above, one may explore Heaven;
below, reach the extremities of Earth;
circulating about, cover the whole of the nine regions."
The "Cheng fa" 成法 section of
the Mawangdui _Shi da jing_ (_Shiliu jing_), 74, states:
"With the One understood,
one may explore Heaven and Earth;
by grasping its inherent principles,
one may reach everywhere within the four seas."
The _Huainanzi_, 1/11b7 (Morgan, _Tao, the Great Luminant_, 18),
and the _Wenzi_, A/4b11-12,
both contain somewhat similar statements.
